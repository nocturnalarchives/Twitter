Reddit's New CEO Michael Seibel Has A Tweet History That Reveals An Anti-Trump Bias, Support of Pro Black Agendas, And Support Of Progressive Politics.


Looking at the tweet history of Reddit's new CEO Michael Seibel tweet history I see clear evidence of an Anti-Trump political Bias, a lot pro-black agenda tweets, and support for progressive politics. Makes it really hard to believe those agendas aren't going to try an infect the day to day operation of Reddit.

<mwseibel> Very fair point.  Clearly we are still at risk for 4 more years of Trump.

<mwseibel> I don’t think is about denouncing Trump.  Acknowledging him empowers him.  He is a classic troll.  He should be ignored (and voted out in Nov).

<mwseibel> America is no longer listening to Donald Trump.  In some fundamental way he is no longer the President of the United States.  It is time for @BarackObama to stand up the retake moral leadership in America.

<mwseibel> Wondering if Trump is saber rattling over trade now to drive markets flat/down so he can ease up on the talk next year during the election and get an artificial jump in the stock market...

<mwseibel> I agree there is huge risk if these platforms embrace being arbiters of the truth.  Just like there was risk in church doing the same or government doing same.  Many think that if there is no arbiter of the truth the world would be a better place.  What if that’s not true?

<mwseibel> Just to share some stats.  Since 2015 YC has funded ~416 female founders, ~151 black founders, and ~201 Latinx founders.  We have a long way to go but please believe that if you join YC you'll be able to find people from many different backgrounds in our community.

2019-08-21 14:40:18 +0100 <mwseibel> As an underrepresented founder myself I will say - Y Combinator gave me advantages that no other startup organization was offering.  Without YC I would not have become successful in the tech startup world.

<mwseibel> My group (Group 5) had two amazing black female founders - Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins from Promise and Lisa Gelobter from tEQuitable.  I don't find it surprising that both of their startups have a strong social impact mission.

2018-04-20 23:22:15 +0100 <mwseibel> I 100% agree we have a lot more work to do to attract underrepresented founders to the program.  In total we had 54 Female Founders and 31 Black/Latinx founders in the W2018 batch.

<mwseibel> These debates are so frustrating. The left arguing with the left and nothing getting done. I love being a liberal but SF is a strange place. You would think it would be a progressive wonderland, but it seems like the same political dynamic that haunts Washington haunt us as well.
