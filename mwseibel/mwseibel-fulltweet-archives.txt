1276702600209920001 2020-06-27 03:23:14 +0100 <mwseibel> That looks great!
1276690273775390720 2020-06-27 02:34:15 +0100 <mwseibel> What did you get?
1275862763051429888 2020-06-24 19:46:01 +0100 <mwseibel> loved it

1275423963141648386 2020-06-23 14:42:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Needless to say, America needs to welcome immigrants.  We also need to elect a new president.  #muchworktodo
1275152921970212865 2020-06-22 20:45:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Amazing post by @Tracy_Young  Reflections on Being a Female Founder  https://tracy.posthaven.com/reflections-on-being-a-female-founder¬†‚Ä¶ - so lucky I got the chance to work with her when she was a visiting partner at YC last batch.
1274827770300788736 2020-06-21 23:13:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol - I am defeated!
1274811525107077120 2020-06-21 22:08:47 +0100 <mwseibel> lol finally we get the root of 90% of twitter arguments!
1274806403752812546 2020-06-21 21:48:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Probably because their Twitter addiction out weighs their good sense.
1274806402930708480 2020-06-21 21:48:25 +0100 <mwseibel> The more I think about it the more I believe that slippery slope is perfect made for Twitter.  Maximum outrage in minimum characters.  Strangely these arguments are used by many smart people who know better.
1274805637587726336 2020-06-21 21:45:23 +0100 <mwseibel> You did it - it‚Äôs all over :(
1274799511299215360 2020-06-21 21:21:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol - true!
1274799431225798661 2020-06-21 21:20:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Most bricks (added or subtracted) don‚Äôt singularity break or build any dams.  Treating every brick like this doesn‚Äôt allow real debate on any topic.
1274799124324339713 2020-06-21 21:19:30 +0100 <mwseibel> And now it‚Äôs a 99% marginal rate... oh wait...
1274798839292035072 2020-06-21 21:18:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Re gun rights: are we more likely to have  open air unregulated gun markets that sell to kids or take guns away from law abiding citizens?  (Hint we have both right now - can we be at both ends of a slippery slope?)
1274798123953475584 2020-06-21 21:15:32 +0100 <mwseibel> You‚Äôre right we are only one slippery slope in any direction from becoming Nazi Germany so we should just stand still.  Or... maybe if we stand still we are already on the slippery slope to Nazi Germany.  It‚Äôs so confusing.  Let‚Äôs just go back to a hunter gatherer society.
1274797299571363841 2020-06-21 21:12:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Cause in my experience it‚Äôs just a lot of people screaming we are going to become Nazi Germany if we do/don‚Äôt do (fill in the blank).
1274796964119408640 2020-06-21 21:10:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Care to share some examples from your experience?
1274795669283209216 2020-06-21 21:05:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Instead of debating the extremes -let‚Äôs discuss how to manage the messy middle.
1274795668570136577 2020-06-21 21:05:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Next time you make the slippery slope argument - try to flip sides and see how it can be used against your position.
1274795667869687808 2020-06-21 21:05:46 +0100 <mwseibel> More often than not I find the slippery slope argument lazy.  It can be applied on either side of an argument to make the other person feel like a tyrant in training.  Good policy lies in the messy middle.  Checks and balances are designed to protect us from the slippery slopes.
1274460269998039040 2020-06-20 22:53:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Go on...
1274447264442757120 2020-06-20 22:01:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks <grin>
1274447126907351043 2020-06-20 22:00:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Good point!
1274447025791090688 2020-06-20 22:00:23 +0100 <mwseibel> We were never a strong company :)
1274443876036513792 2020-06-20 21:47:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Sometimes the strongest founders are the most nervous about fundraising.  I find it strange cause I don‚Äôt think the most attractive people are nervous about finding a date.  Although I‚Äôve never been a very attractive person so maybe I‚Äôm wrong...
1274371898093101058 2020-06-20 17:01:51 +0100 <mwseibel> I really wish we could do this.  To be clear everyone who makes it to the interview stage gets personalized feedback from YC partners.  I‚Äôd love ideas on how to scale this to all applicants.
1274371607847268352 2020-06-20 17:00:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Two thoughts: YC applications are not public so no counter signal.  To be successful you‚Äôll have to convince many people who aren‚Äôt experts in your industry why you will be successful.
1274356188256190464 2020-06-20 15:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> With all that said I fully support even more innovation on this front and more on-ramps into the startup world.  I agree that talented people don‚Äôt have enough access.
1274355668552564736 2020-06-20 15:57:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Also, knowledge of how the startup world works and the patterns of successful are often just as big of a barrier to success as lack of a network.  That is why we created  http://startupschool.org¬† a free startup MOOC that of tens of thousands of founder participate in every year.
1274354468356714497 2020-06-20 15:52:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Sometimes people characterize YC without truly understanding how it‚Äôs benefits have changed over time.  So i just wanted to provide a bit more context.
1274354196360261632 2020-06-20 15:51:31 +0100 <mwseibel> 100% agree about alternatives.  But remember that the YC 7% gives you access to advice, customers, a community of other founders at every stage, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of discounts/free services, and a faster fundraising process with higher valuations.
1274350984341274625 2020-06-20 15:38:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Over 20,000 YC applicants every year would disagree with your characterization of our program.  Furthermore, every batch YC founders with no investor network collectively raise hundreds of millions of dollars to pursue their dreams.

1269342393855164417 2020-06-06 19:56:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Building a great company vs raising a lot of money and hiring a lot of people.

1268979994195161088 2020-06-05 19:56:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Just keep doing good work Nait.  There are tons of people rooting for you.
1268766808124735488 2020-06-05 05:49:14 +0100 <mwseibel> If policing in America doesn‚Äôt change after this - I have no idea what will make it change.
1268766807554318338 2020-06-05 05:49:14 +0100 <mwseibel> The police are turning police reform into an issue that many many more Americans will fight and vote for.  They are literally beating their way to their own downfall.
1268766807042613248 2020-06-05 05:49:14 +0100 <mwseibel> The amount of horrible video I‚Äôm seeing being shared on social media is incredible.  Every video further undermines the idea that the police are here to protect and serve.
1268766806547681280 2020-06-05 05:49:13 +0100 <mwseibel> Every day and night the police are beating the shit out of unarmed Americans peacefully protesting.  If this doesn‚Äôt stop something very bad is going to happen.

1267330916273225728 2020-06-01 06:43:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Cause they won‚Äôt do anything - I don‚Äôt want to waste my breath.
1267221047050371072 2020-05-31 23:26:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Look at this thread.  This isn‚Äôt the country we deserve.  We need police reform now. https://twitter.com/chadloder/status/1266952661791674370¬†‚Ä¶
1267175018687012865 2020-05-31 20:24:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Very fair point.  Clearly we are still at risk for 4 more years of Trump.
1267159523040661510 2020-05-31 19:22:27 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly I don‚Äôt really understand the point you are making.  Asking someone to stand up is not the same as telling people they should sit down.  We should all stand up.
1267158334676914183 2020-05-31 19:17:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Right back at you :) - I enjoyed the conversation.
1267157743737110528 2020-05-31 19:15:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Seems like the same think could have been said about MLK during the civil rights movement.  I believe MLKs leadership helped to improve America (but clearly there is much more work to do).  @BarackObama can be a grand unifying figure for the majority of Americans.
1267156807996358656 2020-05-31 19:11:40 +0100 <mwseibel> I would love these people to step up!  I worry that they don‚Äôt have the credibility to lead us but happy to be proven wrong!
1267153513790033921 2020-05-31 18:58:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Obligated - of course not.  I‚Äôm asking him to.
1267153345816530948 2020-05-31 18:57:54 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôd be happy to tap another leader to take responsibility.  Who do you suggest?  Who will America actually listen to?
1267153060415131649 2020-05-31 18:56:46 +0100 <mwseibel> I think @BarackObama is only the leader who can get Americans to look in the mirror.  I wish this wasn‚Äôt required...
1267152616691322881 2020-05-31 18:55:01 +0100 <mwseibel> I think true systematic change requires leadership and I don‚Äôt see any other American leaders around who can do the job.  I wish we didn‚Äôt have to rely on @BarackObama.  I also agree with you that all Americans need to take responsibility for the change we need.
1267151621366169605 2020-05-31 18:51:03 +0100 <mwseibel> He is a unique American leader.  I‚Äôm *asking* him to serve again.
1267150260977184775 2020-05-31 18:45:39 +0100 <mwseibel> Read the rest of the thread.
1267150015602049031 2020-05-31 18:44:40 +0100 <mwseibel> We certainly need to do our part.  America needs its all of its best leaders to lead.  It times like this I want @BarackObama on the court - not on the bench!
1267148657062744064 2020-05-31 18:39:16 +0100 <mwseibel> To be clear I‚Äôm not calling for a third term in office.  I‚Äôm saying that if @BarackObama stood up and started talking to America, many people would listen.  You don‚Äôt need to hold a formal political office to be a powerful political leader.  See MLK.
1267148094401101824 2020-05-31 18:37:02 +0100 <mwseibel> He doesn‚Äôt need a formal political office in order to lead. See MLK.
1267147268811042821 2020-05-31 18:33:45 +0100 <mwseibel> He doesn‚Äôt need the formal office in order to lead us again.  MLK held no formal political office.
1267144257619611656 2020-05-31 18:21:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I don‚Äôt think is about denouncing Trump.  Acknowledging him empowers him.  He is a classic troll.  He should be ignored (and voted out in Nov).
1267142481709326339 2020-05-31 18:14:44 +0100 <mwseibel> I know of no other leader who has the moral authority to do this.  @BarackObama - America needs you to serve again.
1267142476692889607 2020-05-31 18:14:43 +0100 <mwseibel> He needs no formal political office to do this.  He just needs to speak to us and tell us the America can be better than it is today.  And all Americans can work together to create the nation we deserve.
1267142469529059330 2020-05-31 18:14:41 +0100 <mwseibel> America is no longer listening to Donald Trump.  In some fundamental way he is no longer the President of the United States.  It is time for @BarackObama to stand up the retake moral leadership in America.
1266407200819310592 2020-05-29 17:33:00 +0100 <mwseibel> We need a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù right now. https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1266400635429310466¬†‚Ä¶
1265662517591674881 2020-05-27 16:13:53 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting read - thanks for sharing.
1264739791326687237 2020-05-25 03:07:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Any current Ivy Leaguer is given the right to declare new Ivy League members.  By the power vested in me by the great Yale University I declare Case Western an Ivy League school.  Just print this out and they are good to go <wink>.
1264658238504460288 2020-05-24 21:43:14 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôm down as long as we admit Case Western to the Ivy League.
1263560005086633984 2020-05-21 20:59:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Well we are running a remote batch right now and its going well so far :)
1263478875096375296 2020-05-21 15:36:52 +0100 <mwseibel> If you think a YC partner sarcastically relying to a YC founder‚Äôs sarcastic Tweet is a red flag then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how YC works.  #calmdown
1263298007270744064 2020-05-21 03:38:10 +0100 <mwseibel> What if we all decided to just talk about something else?
1263296282090549249 2020-05-21 03:31:19 +0100 <mwseibel> #can the people I follow talk about anything other than people leaving SF, remote work, Clubhouse, and Zoom.  Im trying to do some quality time wasting here!
1263296281587245056 2020-05-21 03:31:19 +0100 <mwseibel> My guess for me is somewhere between 8-10 each day which is strange because the product makes it feel like you are part of a conversation with a much larger number of people.
1263296281016799233 2020-05-21 03:31:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting Twitter feature would show you which people you follow generate 80% of the stories in your feed each day.
1263293133049049088 2020-05-21 03:18:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Hmm - YC classes are now 40-50% international.
1263290788517044224 2020-05-21 03:09:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Don‚Äôt get caught up in this - you‚Äôve got company building to do.  Leave the debate to folks who have less work to do.
1262822769454010373 2020-05-19 20:09:45 +0100 <mwseibel> I do this daily.  I feel that the topic memes on VC Twitter are mostly a waste of time (Covid being a large exception).
1262434302286913536 2020-05-18 18:26:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Lesson for YC founders - read founders reviews on YC investor database.  Great investors really stand out!
1262380853474275331 2020-05-18 14:53:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Hmm - make that 3 investors and 3 founders.  Should have waited till the morning to write this.
1262236908710621184 2020-05-18 05:21:44 +0100 <mwseibel> YC investor database - founders can leave reviews of their experiences with investors for other YC founders to read.
1262232725487935488 2020-05-18 05:05:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Cheers to all the investors treating founders with respect ‚úäüèΩ.  There are far far more good angel investors than bad ones.
1262228207387832320 2020-05-18 04:47:10 +0100 <mwseibel> :)
1262228023207579649 2020-05-18 04:46:26 +0100 <mwseibel> In the past two weeks I‚Äôve seen two seasoned investors trying to bully YC founders.  In both cases the founders were first time founders and stood up to the bullies.  I‚Äôm proud of them. pic.twitter.com/gGUjyfKRpR
1261498544675975168 2020-05-16 04:27:45 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôd love to do a swap - complaining about SF is boring.  I wish all these complainers would just leave already.  Open up some housing for people who actually want to get some work done here.
1260611997311201280 2020-05-13 17:44:55 +0100 <mwseibel> I have the last model in my home and I love it.  Looking forward to trying this new one ASAP https://twitter.com/m_franceschetti/status/1260606253170151426¬†‚Ä¶
1258137317111238657 2020-05-06 21:51:26 +0100 <mwseibel> we lead far less interesting lives now :)
1257872446847250432 2020-05-06 04:18:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Their hard work, adaptability, and perseverance during this public health crisis is an inspiration.
1257872446406844416 2020-05-06 04:18:56 +0100 <mwseibel> YC interviews have given me the opportunity to meet so many amazing founders from all over the world over the past 1.5 weeks.
1257872445869981697 2020-05-06 04:18:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Instead of tweeting about something that is pissing me off I‚Äôm going to tweet about something positive :)
1253902575805423617 2020-04-25 05:24:05 +0100 <mwseibel> Random evening thought.  I really like working at YC.  It‚Äôs the most fulfilling work I‚Äôll ever do and the best team I‚Äôll ever work with.  If any of you find a job that you would do for free - grab it and hold on tight!

1247728018581143553 2020-04-08 04:28:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Also if I have to hear that all college students are poor one more time...
1247727109633531904 2020-04-08 04:24:59 +0100 <mwseibel> This is why a lot of founders decide to start non-profits instead of tech startups.  Investors, please wake up and realize how many very large businesses serve working class America.  Many of these are ready to be disrupted.
1247727109121818625 2020-04-08 04:24:59 +0100 <mwseibel> All too often I encounter rich investors who believe poor people don‚Äôt have money to pay for any services.  This kills me because it usually the excuse to not invest in a great startup that can profitably help poor people.

1240663057082093573 2020-03-19 15:34:57 +0100 <mwseibel> This is why YC is excited to fund companies this summer.
1240531927326580736 2020-03-19 06:53:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Too many investors are turning their backs on young, low burn, technical, early stage, high margin software companies.  These are the types of teams that more easily survive an economic downturn.

1235418843968724992 2020-03-05 04:16:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Also it would provide so many customers to our saas companies who serve small businesses
1235418657842331650 2020-03-05 04:15:35 +0100 <mwseibel> You are reading my mind
1235347091431600129 2020-03-04 23:31:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Random thought - it would be great to offer this content on  http://Startupschool.org¬† so that we can accomodate people who want to make venture funded tech business and people who want to tech enabled small businesses.
1235346681417392133 2020-03-04 23:29:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Is there a product online that helps people create online small businesses?  ie: create a great shopify store, make money on Ebay, setup an Airbnb, be an Amazon seller, sell products on Etsy, sell shoes on Goat, sell clothes on Poshmark, or sell a subscription box on Createjoy.
1235236357326417926 2020-03-04 16:11:11 +0100 <mwseibel> Fair point!
1235227958735810560 2020-03-04 15:37:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Who knew that boxing in VR with @oculus makes your arms hurt just as bad as punching a bag at the gym (and it‚Äôs way more fun).
1235220164607479808 2020-03-04 15:06:51 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve spoken to the founders about this.
1234745411916595200 2020-03-03 07:40:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Amazing article - BlitzFail: How Not to Go Off the Rails by @DavidSacks https://link.medium.com/Zck1t5PSo4¬†
1233082572822855680 2020-02-27 17:32:49 +0100 <mwseibel> But regardless of this question, great founders tend to be good at both.
1233082572244021248 2020-02-27 17:32:49 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder which of these models is better (both for the founder and for the investor).  The relationship model or the money as a service model.
1233082571669393409 2020-02-27 17:32:49 +0100 <mwseibel> It feels like once you are a growth stage company that is far enough along, often fundraising reverts back to this funding as a service model.  Show a good data room, jump on some calls or quick 1 hr meetings and then consider the offers and take the one that is the right fit.
1233082571090583553 2020-02-27 17:32:49 +0100 <mwseibel> This is a double edged sword though because when it becomes time to raise a Series A, the game is just like it was 10-15 years ago.  This often catches our founders by surprise even though we constantly warm them.
1233082570453049344 2020-02-27 17:32:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Now I encounter many founders at YC who are like I was back then.  What has changed is the process of raising $1-2m seed round after participating in YC is a bit like school.  Be skilled, make progress, tell your story clearly, and often you‚Äôll get funded.
1233082569899433984 2020-02-27 17:32:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I wanted it to work like school.  Submit the right answers and get an A.  You don‚Äôt need to have a real relationship with your teacher in order to get good grades.
1233082569417035776 2020-02-27 17:32:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Interestingly I was told this many times when I was younger.  I wasn‚Äôt missing knowledge, I just didn‚Äôt the world to work that way.
1233082568708247552 2020-02-27 17:32:48 +0100 <mwseibel> With more experience I‚Äôve come to understand that this isn‚Äôt the way things work and especially at the series A and afterwards and investor is commuting real portion of their life and reputation when they write the check.
1233082568171376640 2020-02-27 17:32:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Provide the correct inputs, get cash as an output.  I felt so overwhelmed with just my teammates and users that I didn‚Äôt want to take any time to build relationships with other people.  In fact I lost my friendships during this time as a result.
1233082567559020545 2020-02-27 17:32:48 +0100 <mwseibel> As a founder it was hard for me to understand and acknowledge the humanity of an investor.  I always wanted to treat them like a SaaS product or API instead.
1232725735690784768 2020-02-26 17:54:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Shoutout to @janellehmtam for all the hard work putting this together and @harris for starting the series A program 2 years ago!

1230644153152761856 2020-02-21 00:03:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Classic!  We have one and I didn't realize.
1230638364262424576 2020-02-20 23:40:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Has anyone written an amazing guide to tech startup business models? (I know - YC should already have one...)
1230638144657055744 2020-02-20 23:39:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats!

1230027490539651072 2020-02-19 07:13:01 +0100 <mwseibel> What I can say though is that the YC process is not perfect and sometimes we miss a good company.  Congrats on your progress and I wish you good luck!

1229554062594457600 2020-02-17 23:51:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Your perspective that the founders/framers didn‚Äôt consider these protections in the private sphere is both obvious when you think about it and still interesting.
1229553790556106752 2020-02-17 23:50:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Reading the facts of the case it seems like there is still enough room for regulation.  Your second point is interesting though.  I think many founders use gov protection of free speech as model for how they want their own companies to act.
1229540803875262464 2020-02-17 22:59:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting
1229538070141161472 2020-02-17 22:48:14 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôm not confident the government will be able to effectively/intelligently regulate big tech. What obligations/norms the public will demand of big tech? For large consumer software companies the public actually has the power to enforce norms (if we can agree what they should be).
1229537052015775744 2020-02-17 22:44:11 +0100 <mwseibel> Great article!  I didn‚Äôt understand the history of the arguments that have been built on top of the ‚Äúfire in a crowded theatre example‚Äù.  For me this works just as well: pic.twitter.com/1D1Aa2SPXM
1229533884397678592 2020-02-17 22:31:36 +0100 <mwseibel> (Clearly energy and defense companies are expected to take on additional obligations during wartime for example)
1229533883764396033 2020-02-17 22:31:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Finally at what level of scale/power does a private company have to take on some of the same obligations that we expect from our government?  Which internet companies are getting close to this level?  How have non-tech companies dealt with this in the past?
1229533883172966402 2020-02-17 22:31:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Also why are free speech rights the third rail in our tech community?  In basic civics classes we are taught that you don‚Äôt have the right to yell fire in a crowded theatre.  Does the internet speech have an equivalent?
1229533882661232640 2020-02-17 22:31:35 +0100 <mwseibel> What do you do in the edge cases when the challenges of coordinating/securing a large population conflict with free speech rights?  In government we have courts(and elections) to help.  What do private companies have?
1229148303452860416 2020-02-16 20:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> interesting idea!
1229131580100079617 2020-02-16 19:52:59 +0100 <mwseibel> What has become very clear in this thread is that many are very afraid of any entity controlling what information is available to consume.  What I don't understand is why they don't believe that social media, the education system, and the government do this every day.
1229129725966110720 2020-02-16 19:45:37 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm 100% willing to accept that they can fulfill this elevated responsibility without preventing us from accessing certain information.  Open to ideas!  Maybe FB and Google should take responsibility for teaching us history :)
1229129078990462976 2020-02-16 19:43:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting. I guess my position is that the organizations that control the what information have access to have a elevated responsibility to make sure society thrives. I'd apply this to the education system and the media system (where tv and social media are most powerful).
1229123073346957312 2020-02-16 19:19:11 +0100 <mwseibel> that is a great idea
1229116702786347009 2020-02-16 18:53:52 +0100 <mwseibel> You've basically pointed me to a person (@alexstamos) who is far more informed and who makes my point 100x better.  Thank you :)
1229114464135303168 2020-02-16 18:44:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting clip from this lecture:  https://ytcropper.com/cropped/AT5e498d90f3236¬†‚Ä¶
1229111522242093056 2020-02-16 18:33:17 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting Lecture from @alexstamos that I wanted to push higher in the thread: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2150&v=ATmQj787Jcc&feature=emb_logo¬†‚Ä¶
1229109607865311232 2020-02-16 18:25:40 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting slide: pic.twitter.com/pYtWGcTRp3
1229087870985486337 2020-02-16 16:59:18 +0100 <mwseibel> There is something fundamentally similar between the church telling us what we can and cannot believe and social media algorithms deciding what information is pushed in front of our eyes.  Both are man made and human controlled.
1229087121618550784 2020-02-16 16:56:19 +0100 <mwseibel> I think this is where we disagree: ‚ÄúThey do it already‚Äù is not quite correct, beyond basic rules such as ‚Äúno nipples‚Äù
1229081450659504128 2020-02-16 16:33:47 +0100 <mwseibel> My basic premise is that by controlling what you see the platforms are already the arbiters for truth for most people.  The question is are they doing a good job.
1229081204726497281 2020-02-16 16:32:49 +0100 <mwseibel> In the process of doing that, with a goal of optimizing for engagement/revenue, they are having a significant impact on society.  They should be careful to understand that impact and they should endeavor to make that impact neutral or positive.
1229080911762739200 2020-02-16 16:31:39 +0100 <mwseibel> Basically I believe that our access to information is being controlled by a number of large companies who make money by selling our attention.  In this process, because there is a lot of information the companies basically have to control what we see and don‚Äôt see.
1229080572107952128 2020-02-16 16:30:18 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äòm not sure I understand your argument or what you think my argument is.  This is understandable because this Twitter conversation has refined my thoughts (+1 for Twitter).
1229066214774689793 2020-02-16 15:33:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Probably because most of the people will be on earth and will need something to wear.  Also cause I assume they get good bulk discounts on camo <grin>
1229064707081793536 2020-02-16 15:27:15 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder if you would like the world you lived in if absolute freedom of speech was the law of the land...  it‚Äôs a great idea in theory.  Personal responsibility is also a great idea in theory.
1229064301211602944 2020-02-16 15:25:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - I hope you are getting some sleep!!
1229063888395616256 2020-02-16 15:24:00 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree there is huge risk if these platforms embrace being arbiters of the truth.  Just like there was risk in church doing the same or government doing same.  Many think that if there is no arbiter of the truth the world would be a better place.  What if that‚Äôs not true?
1229062318681542658 2020-02-16 15:17:46 +0100 <mwseibel> I am not smart enough to know the solutions either.  But I think talking about whether there is a problem - especially when I see insiders (the people who make / maintain these products) with kids acting like there is a problem - is important.
1229061675950587905 2020-02-16 15:15:13 +0100 <mwseibel> So in a world where a small number of large companies are basically controlling a large portion of the information everyone consumes - maybe they have the obligation to ensure society doesn‚Äôt descend into chaos.
1229061674742632448 2020-02-16 15:15:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Many have said that we can‚Äôt trust these platforms to police the information we see.  What a strange point because they clearly do this right now.  They decide which of your friends posts you see.  It‚Äôs not a free flow of information - there is too much information.
1229060819909918720 2020-02-16 15:11:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I think they are policing the information we get right now.  It‚Äôs just that they are tuning their sites for what gets us engaged the most.
1229060553139728384 2020-02-16 15:10:45 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the same is happening to social media :)
1229060178680541184 2020-02-16 15:09:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Thought experiment: what would you suggest we do today if you learned (time machine) that the current setup fast forwarded 100 years would lead (in your personal opinion) to a significantly harmed global society?
1229058294469148672 2020-02-16 15:01:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Being addicted to social media (or TV) is either a small or large problem.  It all depends on what content we are consuming on the platform.  As a society if we become addicted to propaganda and misinformation the negative effects can be very harmful.
1229058293718368256 2020-02-16 15:01:46 +0100 <mwseibel> An important improvement to what I‚Äôm trying to say that was tweeted by @markstraub: https://twitter.com/markstraub/status/1229051585713455104?s=20¬†‚Ä¶
1229055820526055425 2020-02-16 14:51:57 +0100 <mwseibel> I think @markstraub made the point better than I did and in fewer words: https://twitter.com/markstraub/status/1229051585713455104?s=20¬†‚Ä¶
1229055297404071939 2020-02-16 14:49:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes!!!  Excellent point.  Completely agree :)
1229055161600884736 2020-02-16 14:49:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Hmm - I feel like the gatekeepers if information have always been the enforcers of what is true (for good or for bad).  This ability for anyone to be a publisher is kind of a new thing.
1229054209204449283 2020-02-16 14:45:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Furthermore I think in the long term the marketplace would reward them for it.
1229054050924032000 2020-02-16 14:44:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Does that mean tech platforms should police everything we say and everything that is shared - no.  But just like email platforms made their products better by policing spam, I think other platforms are missing a similar opportunity.
1229053712594690049 2020-02-16 14:43:34 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree.  I would extend the same obligation to MSNBC and Fox News.  I think we went down a rabbit hole on addiction.  I don‚Äôt think purely spending a bunch of time on social media is very harmful.  I think what can make it harmful is the content you are consuming. Same for TV.
1229052490064089088 2020-02-16 14:38:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly I don‚Äôt know.  It‚Äôs hard but important work.
1228895202481336320 2020-02-16 04:13:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Hmm - really?
1228895011028099073 2020-02-16 04:12:57 +0100 <mwseibel> If you are marketing sugar you should take some responsibility for public health issues that result from over consumption.
1228894610715361285 2020-02-16 04:11:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I see many more people addicted to social media than addicted to books.
1228881324921896961 2020-02-16 03:18:34 +0100 <mwseibel> During my time at Socialcam 2012 I got an education on FB and Youtube.  Using these platforms in the attempt to grow one of my own was a bit scary in hindsight.
1228879587351728129 2020-02-16 03:11:39 +0100 <mwseibel> Personal responsibility is the ‚Äúfall guy‚Äú for so so many problems.  In the meantime though I do believe that individuals should actively limit their time on these platforms.  I do.
1228878970814263296 2020-02-16 03:09:12 +0100 <mwseibel> What do you believe?
1228875554729816064 2020-02-16 02:55:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Good point!  I think as long as the systematic problem exists there is more work to do.  I applaud all the work that is being done to fight this problem.
1228874635510345729 2020-02-16 02:51:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Well I guess the problem is solved :)
1228872969935413248 2020-02-16 02:45:22 +0100 <mwseibel> I remember reading that announcement.  I wish perhaps it was a bit more clear exactly what they are trying to accomplish.  With more clarity they can inspire others to follow their lead.
1228872583929425920 2020-02-16 02:43:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - I don‚Äôt mean to imply that these algorithms / platforms aren‚Äôt giving us what we ask for.  But, when your product is addictive and harmful you have to take more responsibility for the outcomes that you help create.
1228871821493063681 2020-02-16 02:40:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Have they announced this publicly?  I‚Äôd love to be more informed if this is already taking place!
1228870999593979904 2020-02-16 02:37:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Fair - then can we agree that we can try to limit what is easily proven to be a lie.
1228870393114451968 2020-02-16 02:35:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Software engineers inside of these companies have more power than they think.  They can be a spark of change from the inside.  If you don‚Äôt let your kids use the products that your build/maintain - maybe you should reconsider if they should exist in their current forms at all.
1228870392455942144 2020-02-16 02:35:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Algorithms that optimize for engagement are at the heart of Google, Twitter, Youtube, IG, etc.  I think these algorithms will be judged as the cigarettes of the 21st century.
1228870391843569670 2020-02-16 02:35:07 +0100 <mwseibel> If your platform is how the public consumes information than you have some responsibility for the information we consume.
1228870391243759616 2020-02-16 02:35:07 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder if the major platforms would consider reducing their revenue/engagement by 25% if it resulted in a more informed and more united country/world.
1228870390698496000 2020-02-16 02:35:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Tech folks love to blame journalists but we don‚Äôt spend enough time asking who controls their incentives.
1228870390149079040 2020-02-16 02:35:06 +0100 <mwseibel> What if Facebook/Twitter/Google saw it as their responsibility to keep the public informed or at least to limit the reach of lies and conspiracy theories?
1227641227748634625 2020-02-12 17:10:51 +0100 <mwseibel> @StevenLevy great article on FB today and great seeing you yesterday at YC.  This quote resonated: ‚ÄúYou've known me for a long time,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúI don't optimize for fun.‚Äù - Mark

1217475972368236545 2020-01-15 15:57:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Rereading blog pmarca by @pmarca.  ‚Äúentrepreneurial judgment is the ability to tell the difference between a situation that's not working but persistence and iteration will ultimately prove it out...
1217142093665095680 2020-01-14 17:51:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Does SF have problems that need to be solved?  Of course!!!  Is it the festering hellhole that some on twitter make it out to be... nope.
1217142093182693376 2020-01-14 17:51:03 +0100 <mwseibel> For a city, 10-20 years is a relatively shorter period of time.  SF was founded almost 250 years ago and incorporated 170 years ago.
1217142092511629312 2020-01-14 17:51:02 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the root cause of this issue is that for a human 10-20 years is a very long period of time.  16-33% of adulthood and 25-50% of prime working years.
1217142092046036993 2020-01-14 17:51:02 +0100 <mwseibel> People said the same thing about NYC in the 70s and 80s and clearly NYC has not failed.
1217142091534327808 2020-01-14 17:51:02 +0100 <mwseibel> San Francisco is not falling or failing.  All that is happening is that the city is adjusting to change and cities move slower than people like.
1216808463054950400 2020-01-13 19:45:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Had a great 1.5 hr phone conversation with a YC alum that started with a simple 2 min WhatsApp chat.  Great general lesson here - if you wait for the 1 hr meeting it might take a while.  Get a small Interesting conversation going and it can lead to a longer one very quickly.
1216521395150024705 2020-01-13 00:44:37 +0100 <mwseibel> If I complain about other people needlessly complaining - am I being productive? (The question I ask myself before deleting a significant percentage of my tweets).
1215654438104223744 2020-01-10 15:19:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Cooking, cleaning, and not getting in the way.  I was only successful at the first two.  (I also setup the bank account, helped find our apartment, and got our first two sponsors but that didn‚Äôt take much time).
1215116169134276608 2020-01-09 03:40:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Totally agree.  Love to see Twitter iterating the core product! https://twitter.com/kevinrose/status/1215109226470576128¬†‚Ä¶

1211318091705016326 2019-12-29 16:08:32 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing I love about the holidays is that it affords me the time to think more strategically about work and life.  I can unplug from meetings and email to brainstorm how things should be as opposed to just dealing with how things are.

1207766879391010816 2019-12-19 20:57:17 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm constantly trying to figure out the best way to close the gap between what I am doing and what I should be doing.  Needless to say tweeting is often (but not always) the former.

1201903264641323008 2019-12-03 16:37:23 +0100 <mwseibel> I like @Suhail ‚Äòs test:   - If this showed up on Techcrunch would I be embarrassed?  - Is what I am doing going to be hurtful?  - Will this stand the test of time based on the values & principles I ascribe to?   If you don‚Äôt like the answer, don‚Äôt do it.
1201903263773159424 2019-12-03 16:37:23 +0100 <mwseibel> @paulg makes a good point - there are lies that do absolutely no harm.  These are often required in startups.  But be careful because if you get this math wrong there are serious consequences. No one said this stuff is easy.

1201604812418306050 2019-12-02 20:51:26 +0100 <mwseibel> That's a good point.  I'm going to think of a better way to communicate this advice.  There is a line between hustling and lying.  Startups often can't succeed without some hustling.
1201584518181900288 2019-12-02 19:30:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - this doesn't just apply to investors.  Lying to employees will produce the same results.
1201583702519746560 2019-12-02 19:27:33 +0100 <mwseibel> Also when you are caught lying, assume that everyone who you lied to will bring this up whenever they are asked about you... forever.
1201583327549050887 2019-12-02 19:26:04 +0100 <mwseibel> An exception doesn't always disprove a rule.
1201573186015551490 2019-12-02 18:45:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Make sure that no matter the fate of your startup, your reputation as a honest founder does not get tarnished.  That way you are always in the position to start another company in the future.
1201573184937562112 2019-12-02 18:45:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Many startup founders consider lying as a way to get ahead.  The vast majority quickly realize that whatever short term gain they might get from lying will be erased by the long term consequences **when** they get caught.  Be honest.
1201221979103064064 2019-12-01 19:30:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Love seeing YC alumni give back!  Thank you :)
1199756693057368064 2019-11-27 18:27:40 +0100 <mwseibel> 100% agree.  Literally it's the holy land for almost all who want to start tech startups around the world.  Let's make sure we take good care of it.

1196473859177734144 2019-11-18 17:02:52 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve had founders tell me they have trouble getting non gaming apps approved for the App Store - which seems so strange to me...
1196473671688212481 2019-11-18 17:02:07 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree - I think the Qwest is massively underrated.  I really hope FB can learn how to run the App Store.  I think there is a lot of untapped potential right at their finger tips.

1181405076486705152 2019-10-08 04:04:54 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree.  What should we call it?
1181399243300298753 2019-10-08 03:41:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - I'm "addicted" to many useful products and services.
1181391666550198273 2019-10-08 03:11:37 +0100 <mwseibel> If you are actively monetizing a human addiction you really have to think hard about whether you are making the world a better or worse place.  Humans regularly become addicted to products that are very harmful.
1179539836840996864 2019-10-03 00:33:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Agreed - sad Apple is moving in this direction.  For the longest time they were one of the gold star examples of a great developer ecosystem.  Moves like this start to undermine that reputation.  Can't they just compete on the app store like everyone else?
1179539394941743104 2019-10-03 00:31:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I'll take the bait - what would you do with $10b dollars?

1174374901563551744 2019-09-18 18:29:30 +0100 <mwseibel> PS: I‚Äôm also giving this advice to myself because I think it‚Äôs one of my biggest weaknesses when trying to help our founders.
1174374901005729792 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> If you find yourself giving advice to an early stage startup - please remember that all the best tactical advice won‚Äôt matter if the founders lose faith in themselves.
1174374900439470080 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> To sum up - one of the underrated qualities of successful founders is their ability to manage their emotions and fears while still executing.
1174374899818749952 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> And finally convincing yourself that you cannot make something large and positively impactful in the world.  Many talented people with good ideas convince themselves of the opposite.
1174374899189571584 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> You are personally responsible for developing methods to destress (coaches / therapists / cofounders / friends /a significant other can be very helpful).
1174374898585571328 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Another error is not acknowledging upfront how rare success is and how hard it will be to accomplish.  Please expect to feel bad a lot and deal with a lot of failure.  Don‚Äôt believe the startup hype.
1174374897931317250 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Another error is giving into imposter syndrome.  Not realizing that pre-product market fit everyone is struggling to simply survive - no matter their traffic, revenue, famous investors, or cash on hand.
1174374897335685120 2019-09-18 18:29:29 +0100 <mwseibel> In startups even the smart and motivated fail very often.  There is a lot of timing, luck, speed, and original thinking required to make a company successful.
1174374896744333313 2019-09-18 18:29:28 +0100 <mwseibel> One of the biggest errors they make is over relying on the opinions/actions of their peer group.  In most jobs if you surround yourself with smart motivated people and you act similarly to them you‚Äôll succeed.
1174374896173899776 2019-09-18 18:29:28 +0100 <mwseibel> I now spend the most time trying to explain to founders how startups defeat themselves.
1174374895506997248 2019-09-18 18:29:28 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve learned a lot about giving advice over the past 5 years at YC (still more to learn).  When I started I had a very formulaic / tactical view of how startups succeed.  Over time and after seeing over 1000 startups go through YC that has changed.
1174336105019101185 2019-09-18 15:55:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Many many reps :)
1172673923973926912 2019-09-14 01:50:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats :)
1172560589920423936 2019-09-13 18:20:04 +0100 <mwseibel> We had a great time with @jopwell and a number of great founders last night!  Looking forward to more Jopwell events! https://twitter.com/domoniquefines/status/1172341222863790080¬†‚Ä¶
1172333576739647493 2019-09-13 03:18:00 +0100 <mwseibel> If you want to know what it's like at startup, join YC's internship program to find a YC startup for the summer: https://workatastartup.com/internships¬†
1172187639266590720 2019-09-12 17:38:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats @middeskhq https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/middesk/¬†‚Ä¶
1172186384095993856 2019-09-12 17:33:06 +0100 <mwseibel> In NYC for the day talking to founders and future founders.  @Jopwell thank you for hosting!
1170760070696538112 2019-09-08 19:05:27 +0100 <mwseibel> You can check out more information here: http://startupschool.org/¬†
1170760069241167872 2019-09-08 19:05:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Right now tens of thousands of founders (and future founders) around the world are participating in this program for free.
1170760067487895552 2019-09-08 19:05:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Most of these stops are part of the @startupschool tour which actually started during the batch.
1170758013323534337 2019-09-08 18:57:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Also I‚Äôm planning a trip to Egypt and Lagos next year because we now have a sizable number of YC alumni from both countries.  Excited!
1170758012664893441 2019-09-08 18:57:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Needless to say - there are great founders all over the world and we want to fund them.
1170758011968573440 2019-09-08 18:57:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Over the next 2-3 months YC partners will be visiting Mexico City, Bogota, S√£o Paulo, Toronto/Waterloo, Buenos Aires, London, Berlin, New York City, Paris, Bangalore, and Tel Aviv.
1170758011490426880 2019-09-08 18:57:16 +0100 <mwseibel> S2019 was an amazing batch.  Now that it‚Äôs fall YC starts traveling...
1169282752493039616 2019-09-04 17:15:07 +0100 <mwseibel> We are also headed to NYC :) https://twitter.com/ycombinator/status/1169249026111418369¬†‚Ä¶
1169281736120815616 2019-09-04 17:11:04 +0100 <mwseibel> YC coming to Brazil :) https://twitter.com/ycombinator/status/1169241350216310784¬†‚Ä¶
1168937147551965190 2019-09-03 18:21:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Now that it is admissions season at YC lots of founders have questions about our process.  The vast majority of questions are answered here:  https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/¬†
1168917107947556864 2019-09-03 17:02:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Try  http://captable.io¬†
1168896113547587584 2019-09-03 15:38:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Twitch was a redesign of  http://Justin.tv¬†.  It had the same backend and same user accounts.  Socialcam was an entirely new product built from ground up.  Splitting Twitch from JTV would have been basically impossible.
1168894819197997056 2019-09-03 15:33:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Use post money SAFE
1168671188152766464 2019-09-03 00:44:58 +0100 <mwseibel> I assume legal right?  A spin out is a legal term.
1168669306772574213 2019-09-03 00:37:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Twitch wasn't spun out of  http://Justin.tv¬†.  Socialcam was.  Twitch and  http://Justin.tv¬† were the same company.
1168669081798529024 2019-09-03 00:36:36 +0100 <mwseibel> I'd love to figure out who is giving the opposite advice here!
1167526753029345280 2019-08-30 20:57:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Demo day in 70 seconds - crazy! https://twitter.com/domoniquefines/status/1167504172133994496¬†‚Ä¶
1167308482007011328 2019-08-30 06:30:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Two full 9 hr days of office hours this week were super fun.  Great way to relax and catch up with YC alums / current batch post demo day.  Still need to finish clearing my inbox - lots of messages from future YC founders to reply to!
1167109721557389313 2019-08-29 17:20:16 +0100 <mwseibel> To be clear - we love when alumni help founders with mock interviews.  And we appreciate that you respect the YC admissions process.  We want to discourage investors who use the mock interview process to disrupt the YC admissions process.  Which is becoming more common.
1167085848350715904 2019-08-29 15:45:24 +0100 <mwseibel> I hope it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm joking.
1167085089475317762 2019-08-29 15:42:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Super clever...
1166877989214097409 2019-08-29 01:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Tons of work still to do but got a baby at home so work will have to wait a few hours :).  The strange perk of having kids is the amazing excuse to unplug and enjoy spending time with them.
1166711828526915584 2019-08-28 14:59:11 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats on the fundraise! https://twitter.com/usetesorio/status/1166463200147062785¬†‚Ä¶
1165169586091675648 2019-08-24 08:50:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Be careful not to become what you hate in others.
1165101737650245633 2019-08-24 04:21:15 +0100 <mwseibel> :) - that‚Äôs why we have the YC growth program - https://blog.ycombinator.com/growth-stage-program/¬†‚Ä¶
1164995877498310656 2019-08-23 21:20:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Love it!  Let‚Äôs get Mitch out of the Senate for good. https://twitter.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1164960566303219712¬†‚Ä¶
1164994719497089024 2019-08-23 21:16:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Evidence that cold email works! https://twitter.com/Loedx/status/1164990917830414336¬†‚Ä¶
1164990675089182720 2019-08-23 20:59:56 +0100 <mwseibel> You need to be the source of your own motivation.  This startup game is hard.
1164990537021054976 2019-08-23 20:59:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Anything and everything.
1164960934445473792 2019-08-23 19:01:45 +0100 <mwseibel> It's so much fun when I see a company in YC that originally reached out to me in a cold email.  It happens much more often than people would believe.
1164957093389991938 2019-08-23 18:46:29 +0100 <mwseibel> 50% of my email replies tell people to check out the startup school library:  https://www.startupschool.org/library¬†.  If you are a founder who is looking for a 1 stop place for startup advice - click the link.
1164952417273651200 2019-08-23 18:27:54 +0100 <mwseibel> @Superhuman
1164950603811835904 2019-08-23 18:20:42 +0100 <mwseibel> It depends on what the product is.  If you are building software than the technical co-founder would be a software developer.
1164949511648600064 2019-08-23 18:16:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes but not often.  Two examples: @naturallclub and @LUSbrands.
1164948491275124737 2019-08-23 18:12:18 +0100 <mwseibel> If possible I'd recommend trying to recruit a technical cofounder.  You can advice on this and many other topics here:  https://www.startupschool.org/library¬†
1164948490625011712 2019-08-23 18:12:18 +0100 <mwseibel> One of the most common has been the challenges of being a non-technical founder working with a dev shop.  More often than not lots of money and time spent for a product that doesn't grow and needs a lot of bug fixes and improvements.
1164948489911975936 2019-08-23 18:12:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - As I get through my 1000 founder email backlog (577 to go) I'm sharing notes and observations from the founders who have reached out to me.
1164945772162342912 2019-08-23 18:01:30 +0100 <mwseibel> The chances of becoming a very successful founder are worse than 1000 to 1.  As a founder don't be intimidated by YC's acceptance rate.  If you are successful, you will have to do many many harder things than getting into YC.

1164596614431834112 2019-08-22 18:54:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Drop me an email.  I'm happy to give you feedback on what you are working on and how to best talk about it in a YC application.  I appreciate the suggestion around changing the video but I actually don't believe it is what is holding underrepresented founders back.
1164569748379541504 2019-08-22 17:07:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Happy to chat about this more - feel free to email me: michael@ycombinator.com
1164567299925237760 2019-08-22 16:57:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Please share your experience with me.  Michael@ycombinator.com
1164261591015051264 2019-08-21 20:42:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I believe Tiffani is being honest and I am certainly not shunning her.  We clearly have to learn from our alumni's experiences in order to make YC better.
1164247839964221440 2019-08-21 19:48:10 +0100 <mwseibel> I am really sorry that this happened.  I understand if an apology feels many days late and many dollars short but I offer one anyways.  I'm pissed that we had any part in you having this experience.
1164244361132965888 2019-08-21 19:34:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you.  I hope we've already made some substantial changes in the past 4 years since your batch but I'm 100% open to learning about what more we can do.  I'm sure there is a lot.
1164243926032646144 2019-08-21 19:32:37 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm trying hard to make that happen :)
1164243611510136832 2019-08-21 19:31:22 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm sorry that you felt that way.
1164243276863422464 2019-08-21 19:30:02 +0100 <mwseibel> I'd also love for you to share your experience - both the positives and the negatives.
1164243045014896640 2019-08-21 19:29:07 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree YC has a lot more to do before we can claim that we are a "super-supportive, inclusive place for every founder."
1164241546914349056 2019-08-21 19:23:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Or that their time in YC will be horrible.  These are the myths that I am trying to correct.
1164241428496576513 2019-08-21 19:22:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Tiffani - I'm not trying to declare victory.  I tried to be very clear in my thread today there is a ton of work todo.  But that work is much harder if potential underrepresented founders believe they have no chance to get into YC.
1164240534631669760 2019-08-21 19:19:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Also in replies to this thread I've shared batch stats which we make public here: https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/batch-stats/¬†‚Ä¶
1164240260873670656 2019-08-21 19:18:03 +0100 <mwseibel> No attempt to parade.  Sometimes founders tell me that they don't know anyone who is underrepresented who has participated in YC.  I just want to let them know that these people exist and that potential founders can speak to them.
1164226280859922432 2019-08-21 18:22:30 +0100 <mwseibel> :)
1164225405621944320 2019-08-21 18:19:01 +0100 <mwseibel> No need for a pipeline.  Everyone just applies here:  https://apply.ycombinator.com/¬†
1164212645743849475 2019-08-21 17:28:19 +0100 <mwseibel> This is great to hear :)

1164211959673184256 2019-08-21 17:25:35 +0100 <mwseibel> We enjoyed having you :)
1164210895813107712 2019-08-21 17:21:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Just to share some stats.  Since 2015 YC has funded ~416 female founders, ~151 black founders, and ~201 Latinx founders.  We have a long way to go but please believe that if you join YC you'll be able to find people from many different backgrounds in our community.

1164204764814438401 2019-08-21 16:57:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Good point.  I will say though that Yale worked for me and it‚Äôs founders weren‚Äôt very diverse.
1164199431597506561 2019-08-21 16:35:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Also I shared the link so you could see who founded YC.  Wasn‚Äôt trying to make a point about diversity.
1164198882399490048 2019-08-21 16:33:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Don‚Äôt we want to encourage people to go to good schools?
1164198674781503488 2019-08-21 16:32:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Happy to chat. I‚Äôll email you :)
1164195020347285506 2019-08-21 16:18:17 +0100 <mwseibel>  https://www.ycombinator.com/people/¬†
1164194825282838528 2019-08-21 16:17:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Nope - I started as a YC founder in 2007.
1164192517107015680 2019-08-21 16:08:20 +0100 <mwseibel> There is room for many new ideas üôÇ
1164191754406391808 2019-08-21 16:05:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Also, most of our partnership comes from our alumni base where we have made many efforts to diversify.  I‚Äôm confident that as these alumni succeed we will have a much more diverse pool of potential partners to recruit from.
1164191027634118656 2019-08-21 16:02:25 +0100 <mwseibel> I appreciate the feedback and the suggestions and I agree YC can feel a insular.  I hope  http://StartupSchool.org¬† is fighting to change this reputation - it‚Äôs completely open, free, available around the world, and tens of thousands participate.
1164184970820087809 2019-08-21 15:38:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks!
1164173744694153216 2019-08-21 14:53:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you - these are issues we take very seriously.
1164173258456829952 2019-08-21 14:51:48 +0100 <mwseibel>  https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/batch-stats/¬†‚Ä¶
1164170363737001992 2019-08-21 14:40:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Wouldn‚Äôt be a shame if I had been discouraged from participating by people trying to look out for my best interests.  If that was the case amount other things YC would not have a black CEO.
1164170363032309765 2019-08-21 14:40:18 +0100 <mwseibel> As an underrepresented founder myself I will say - Y Combinator gave me advantages that no other startup organization was offering.  Without YC I would not have become successful in the tech startup world.
1164170362289922050 2019-08-21 14:40:18 +0100 <mwseibel> In the effort to make the startup world more inclusive, I hope people don‚Äôt scare potential underrepresented founders away from opportunities like YC that can often best help them bring their startup ideas to the world.
1164170361602109441 2019-08-21 14:40:18 +0100 <mwseibel> By no means do I think YC is perfect but I don‚Äôt think there is a institution in the startup world that is more helpful, more inclusive, and more supportive to startup founders.
1164170361061068801 2019-08-21 14:40:17 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôm happy to try to address your concerns and intro you to founders who have participated in YC recently.
1164170360129855490 2019-08-21 14:40:17 +0100 <mwseibel> If you are an underrepresented founder who is concerned about whether you will feel welcomed at YC please reach out: michael@ycombinator.com.
1164170359437836288 2019-08-21 14:40:17 +0100 <mwseibel> One of the most common conversations I have with them afterwards is how YC isn‚Äôt what they expected (btw: they also offer constructive criticism which we learn from).
1164170358703837192 2019-08-21 14:40:17 +0100 <mwseibel> Often times they were told that YC would not be welcoming to them by well meaning people who never participated in YC.  YC is just lumped in with everything about tech that is bad and unwelcoming.
1164170357827223552 2019-08-21 14:40:17 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing I didn‚Äôt understand until after working at YC was how hard I had to fight to change underrepresented founders ideas of what their experience would be at YC (this includes minorities, women, international founders, and many others).
1163992718759976961 2019-08-21 02:54:24 +0100 <mwseibel> I am very curious as well.  Please let us know.

1163926315050778624 2019-08-20 22:30:32 +0100 <mwseibel> 1) Not saying what you are working on.  2) Not writing a concise email.  3) Asking for a meeting up front.    Here is some advice on how to ask for advice: http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
1163926314283220994 2019-08-20 22:30:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Now that demo day is wrapping up I'm getting through a backlog of about 1000 emails from non-yc founders who have reached out to me.  Three most common mistakes in these emails....
1163918108978892800 2019-08-20 21:57:56 +0100 <mwseibel> If you'd like to attend in person next year let me know (michael@ycombinator.com).  I think you'd find a lot of companies you'd enjoy talking to.
1163917724164116480 2019-08-20 21:56:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Hey Alex.  Two things.  1) Most companies are raising on post money SAFEs.  2) Most companies are raising at well below a $15m cap.
1163887298900922368 2019-08-20 19:55:30 +0100 <mwseibel> thank you :)
1163564403683278848 2019-08-19 22:32:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you to all the investors and alumni who provided feedback after the last demo day :)
1163564289644384256 2019-08-19 22:31:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Lots of changes for this demo day: 1 stage instead of 2, hot lunch for founders and investors, hardware demos on both days, full theatre stage, self check-in kiosks, LCD presentation screen, floor carpeting and much more.  @domoniquefines did an amazing job.  Best demo day yet.

1157652145803366400 2019-08-03 14:59:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Reading the thread this morning.  I‚Äôm sure the Startup School team is already looking into this and I‚Äôll check in with them.  Thank you for letting us know.
1156577771621093377 2019-07-31 15:50:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats!  It‚Äôs been a lot of fun working together :)
1155634711445696512 2019-07-29 01:22:40 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs a long race :) Btw - I met you cofounder the other day.  She seems great!
1155540278842781696 2019-07-28 19:07:26 +0100 <mwseibel> (Btw - by peers I was referring to other early stage founders)
1155534875534827520 2019-07-28 18:45:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Also through office hours we take time (if asked) to break down advice from first principles and dig into whether our general advice applies to a specific situation/company.
1155534874842816512 2019-07-28 18:45:57 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing we try to do at YC is build a community where founders can be more open with each other about their actual experience (good or bad).
1155534873987129344 2019-07-28 18:45:57 +0100 <mwseibel> ... Even more tricky, in the early stage startup world most founders are not publicly truthful about how much/little success they are achieving.  There is so much cargo cutting going on that it‚Äôs hard to separate truth from fiction.
1155534873202839552 2019-07-28 18:45:57 +0100 <mwseibel> ... however in startups this strategy should be used in moderation.  Startups are much more like the NBA.  Almost no one makes it and your peers often have no better idea of how to succeed than you do...
1155534872334594048 2019-07-28 18:45:57 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing I see amongst young founders is that they often defer to the consensus opinion of their peers.  In much of their previous educational experience this was a good strategy for success...
1155472015718903808 2019-07-28 14:36:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Clearly all seed funds don‚Äôt suck.
1155311767016181762 2019-07-28 03:59:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Deck ninjas move faster than light :)

1153739158151561216 2019-07-23 19:50:25 +0100 <mwseibel> We are hiring an admissions office at YC - learn more about the role and apply here:  https://jobs.lever.co/ycombinator/4d50ef71-383a-4b17-9f05-2d809e49bfc0¬†‚Ä¶
1153700063706677255 2019-07-23 17:15:04 +0100 <mwseibel> So be honest with yourself and hold yourself accountable.
1153700062897115138 2019-07-23 17:15:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Often times you know that you are doing these things and just come to think it‚Äôs okay because no one calls you out on it.  But trust me, all of your good people keep a mental accounting of your work.  And when you stay in the red for too long they will leave.
1153700062242824193 2019-07-23 17:15:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Do your employees feel like they can connect with you personally?
1153700061420781568 2019-07-23 17:15:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Being a bad example inside of your company can be a subtle thing.  Do you take credit or give it?  Do you participate in any shit work or do you delegate it all?  Do you show up?  Do you seek to increase your personal brand at the potential detriment of your company‚Äôs brand?
1153700060560891904 2019-07-23 17:15:03 +0100 <mwseibel> One painful mistake I have seen time and time again are CEOs who are not good examples to their employees.  Especially in companies that are under 100 people where the CEO is very visible.
1153700059613032449 2019-07-23 17:15:03 +0100 <mwseibel> They will almost never straight say it‚Äôs because of you to your face...
1153700058845474816 2019-07-23 17:15:03 +0100 <mwseibel> This is dangerous because often times you think you are doing well when you are actually doing poorly.  One strong hint that you need to change is when good people decide to leave your org.
1153700058111496192 2019-07-23 17:15:03 +0100 <mwseibel> It is very hard for a CEO to be a great leader inside of their company.  One reason why is that very few people inside an org feel comfortable providing honest feedback and holding them accountable.
1152755265357303808 2019-07-21 02:40:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Caution to founders: don‚Äôt hero worship startup investors.  They are just normal people with gifts, faults, and personal motivations.  Also, please don‚Äôt seek an investor who will tell you what to do.  If they knew exactly what to do in your business - they should be running it.
1152754382884102144 2019-07-21 02:37:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Second David‚Äôs advice.  I‚Äôd consider a remembrance at the company as well.
1151931931287625728 2019-07-18 20:09:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks!  Great to hear from you - I hope all is well :)
1151931841256906752 2019-07-18 20:08:47 +0100 <mwseibel> All done for now :)

1149440703413407744 2019-07-11 23:09:53 +0100 <mwseibel> YC is coming to your city this summer/fall with Startup School. https://twitter.com/nolimits/status/1149436908734300160¬†‚Ä¶
1149345993697054720 2019-07-11 16:53:33 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw (twitter disclaimer) this isn‚Äôt a knock on tech journalist who focus other topics.
1149345115309146112 2019-07-11 16:50:03 +0100 <mwseibel> By advocates I mean they spend most of their time writing about tech products that they think their audience would be interested in using.
1149345114558357504 2019-07-11 16:50:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Who are the top 5 tech journalists today who are the largest advocates for tech startups specifically (vs the tech industry in general)?  I‚Äôd love to speak to them!
1148829421282848771 2019-07-10 06:40:52 +0100 <mwseibel> LOL - I didn't know the source until today.  Consider the source cited!  Thanks for the advice - I've used it many many times.
1148598400436375553 2019-07-09 15:22:53 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - this is not permission to do things that are unethical or illegal!
1148598398880223232 2019-07-09 15:22:52 +0100 <mwseibel> A lesson I learned from @tripadler many years ago.  You never ask legal whether you can do something at your startup.  Instead ask how you can do what you'd like to do and what are the risks.  Then after hearing their thoughts it's your job to make a call one way or the other.
1148379544446853120 2019-07-09 00:53:13 +0100 <mwseibel> Take a look... https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1148317244893597696¬†‚Ä¶
1148258586058825729 2019-07-08 16:52:35 +0100 <mwseibel> After some success it is hard to recreate the fear that I felt in my early startup career.  I need to find new sources of motivation.  Thankfully I work at YC where I get the ultimate opportunity to give back to the startup community that changed my life for the better.
1148258585261965313 2019-07-08 16:52:34 +0100 <mwseibel> There is something about facing utter destruction that allows me to reach the highest gear, care the most, and be the most productive.  In school I was the ultimate procrastinator because I needed that pressure to perform.  That is why startups got the most out of me.
1145744911452557313 2019-07-01 18:24:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Your product development cycle should have enough structure so that you/your team can look back and understand what your goals were, what your core assumptions were, whether you accomplished your goals, and what you learned.  The easiest way to do this is to write things down.
1145744909812535298 2019-07-01 18:24:08 +0100 <mwseibel> But I advise YC founders to decide on a product decision making process and then iterate it during the early days of their startup.
1145744908298403840 2019-07-01 18:24:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Many first time founders in their early stages dislike any type of codified process/reporting/meetings etc.
1145744906721341441 2019-07-01 18:24:07 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing I think many early stage companies need to work on is what their internal process of decision making will be to facilitate moving quickly.
1145744904804610055 2019-07-01 18:24:06 +0100 <mwseibel> One of my partners at YC Dalton Caldwell @daltonc pointed out last week that the speed of action is one of the most valuable metrics for predicting the success of a company https://twitter.com/daltonc/status/1141394205580787713?s=20¬†‚Ä¶
1145744902933897223 2019-07-01 18:24:06 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve previously written about the product development cycle and I‚Äôm starting to think about how these concepts relate to one another. http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/product-development-cycle-fundamentals¬†‚Ä¶
1145744901293801472 2019-07-01 18:24:06 +0100 <mwseibel> His work has been applied by many to various aspects of the business world.
1145744899549085696 2019-07-01 18:24:05 +0100 <mwseibel> Boyd believes that military leaders can use this loop to compress decision making time and gain an advantage over their enemy.
1145744897749770241 2019-07-01 18:24:05 +0100 <mwseibel> One commonly known fact about Boyd was that he invented the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act).  If you want to read more about that check out the Wikipedia article  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop¬†
1145744895237394433 2019-07-01 18:24:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Read this book about John Boyd and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in military strategy or the military industrial complex in America from the 60s - 90s. https://www.amazon.com/Boyd-Fighter-Pilot-Who-Changed/dp/0316796883/ref=nodl_¬†‚Ä¶
1143320979021553665 2019-06-25 01:52:17 +0100 <mwseibel> Real answer - great vacations, having kids, comfortable home, good friends just to name a few for me.
1143320489768574977 2019-06-25 01:50:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the same lesson can apply to business.  When you are getting exactly what you want... sometimes it‚Äôs best to dig a little deeper.  Maybe you aren‚Äôt really seeing what is right in front of you.
1143320488753520640 2019-06-25 01:50:21 +0100 <mwseibel> As a below average chess player I always have to stop myself when I think my opposition has made a mistake and there is an easy piece to capture...
1142901072312197120 2019-06-23 22:03:44 +0100 <mwseibel> You are right I could have been more clear.  What I probably should have said is I'm talking about "wildly successful often billionaire Founder / CEOs of the biggest tech companies in the world".
1142893960051986433 2019-06-23 21:35:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Cool - not the point I was trying to make but Twitter is not ideal for making narrow points.  Was really speaking about top 25 tech CEOs not startup founders.  Happy to continue the conversation over email - michael@ycombinator.com.
1142881666320359427 2019-06-23 20:46:37 +0100 <mwseibel> I feel like not enough people understand the Yammer story.  I end referring to it when talking to YC startups all the time.
1142834625565188097 2019-06-23 17:39:42 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree!
1142832243301183493 2019-06-23 17:30:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol!  I wish we could trust the government to convert our tax dollars into good works at an efficient rate.  But evidence suggests that this isn‚Äôt always possible.  Also nowadays it‚Äôs harder for government to attract the smartest minds to spend that money.
1142831239277056000 2019-06-23 17:26:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Happy to chat about this more over email - I think it‚Äôs an interesting topic.  Feel free to drop me a note - michael@ycombinator.com
1142829721522061312 2019-06-23 17:20:13 +0100 <mwseibel> I was also a beneficiary of the same thing with my second startup Socialcam.
1142829480043405313 2019-06-23 17:19:15 +0100 <mwseibel> I still don‚Äôt want to call out names not but I can think of two tech billionaires off the top of my head who got paid through a large acquisition and whose companies were written off and products taken offline.
1142828304199643137 2019-06-23 17:14:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Maybe we should create a financial system that rewards them for investing in R&D, their employees, their communities, and society as a whole in addition to achieving the highest stock price.
1142828303155261440 2019-06-23 17:14:34 +0100 <mwseibel> These are some of the most impactful people in the world with some of the largest platforms that have ever been created.  Their resources are immense and growing.
1142828302123454464 2019-06-23 17:14:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Holding a group to a higher standard is a sign of respect not an insult.  I‚Äôm ridiculously impressed by what the top 25 tech CEOs/founders have accomplished.  Now let‚Äôs encourage them to do even more to make the world a better place during their careers in addition to retirement.
1142826049488605184 2019-06-23 17:05:37 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs funny I‚Äôve been thinking about this comment for a couple hours until I realized something.  You are putting these two groups into opposition.  Why?
1142800964904050689 2019-06-23 15:25:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Check out number 3:  https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/academics/clarke_business_law_institute/corporations-and-society/Common-Misunderstandings-About-Corporations.cfm¬†‚Ä¶
1142599574223069184 2019-06-23 02:05:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Sorry you feel that way.
1142579586430992384 2019-06-23 00:46:16 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree (for the most part).  I have a couple in mind who haven‚Äôt but let‚Äôs not call them out.  Now let‚Äôs see them 10x that impact!
1142578450110173184 2019-06-23 00:41:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol!  Definitely talking to the rich.  Trying to call out the top 25 tech CEOs - not the struggling founders.
1142534189763330048 2019-06-22 21:45:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - in my experience wealthy people convert money into happiness extremely inefficiently.  It‚Äôs actually embarrassing compared to their other obvious talents.
1142534188664422400 2019-06-22 21:45:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Imagine being a shareholder of a company because you were proud of the positive force they had on society.  You‚Äôd probably be the type of shareholder every CEO dreams of.
1142534187666173952 2019-06-22 21:45:52 +0100 <mwseibel> CEOs use their shareholders as an excuse to compete in a meaningless game.  Their legacies are sacrificed in the name of creating shareholder economic value.  They will not appear in history books.
1142534186739232768 2019-06-22 21:45:52 +0100 <mwseibel> To build a big company, get rich, and use the company‚Äôs reach and power to make the world a better place.
1142534185816428544 2019-06-22 21:45:51 +0100 <mwseibel> We need to change to model from build a big company, get rich, and then starting a foundation...
1142534184742711296 2019-06-22 21:45:51 +0100 <mwseibel> They already have all the money/things they could ever want...  if they measured themselves by how much they made the world better every year... watch out!  Needless to say these folks are pretty competitive.
1142534183643840512 2019-06-22 21:45:51 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôm waiting for the day that the top 25 tech CEOs start competing for impact.
1142534182523981824 2019-06-22 21:45:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Successful tech founders would have far better lives and legacies if they competed for happiness and impact instead of wealth and users/revenue.
1142534181513117696 2019-06-22 21:45:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Prevalent in the valley is the competition for rev/valuation/users as a proxy for impact/making the world a better place.
1142534180594573312 2019-06-22 21:45:50 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve noticed that many people compete in games they don‚Äôt understand because they are modeling the behavior of people around them.  Most common is the competition for wealth as a proxy for happiness.
1139580359975161856 2019-06-14 18:08:24 +0100 <mwseibel> But you shouldn't assume you know your LTV, you shouldn't assume your CAC will stay constant, you shouldn't assume that a purchase means you are solving the customer's problem, and you should be worried if your payback period if high.
1139580359341772802 2019-06-14 18:08:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Something @daltonc pointed out to me over slack.  My tweet doesn't mean if you have a live service with cohort data you should be ignoring all of your metrics.  You should know your CAC and you should measure your payback period and be trying make it as small as possible.
1139557317488201728 2019-06-14 16:36:51 +0100 <mwseibel> yes! ideally you should get paid back immediately
1139555675665649664 2019-06-14 16:30:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Early stage founders should ask themselves:  Can you narrowly identify the customer who has the problem you are solving?  How intense is this problem and how willing are they to pay?  Does your solution actually solve the problem?  Are you retaining customers?
1139554888583528449 2019-06-14 16:27:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Many people are telling me to direct this feedback to early stage investors as well.... so consider this a note to them as well.
1139549514769895424 2019-06-14 16:05:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Further proof - the number of pre-product market fit founders who ask me when is the right time to start Blitzscaling.
1139549513889148928 2019-06-14 16:05:50 +0100 <mwseibel> I really hate when early stage startups talk about CAC / LTV.  In the early stage it's almost impossible to know either.  What I've realized is that way too much later stage advice is being absorbed and acted upon by early stage founders.
1138777736493842432 2019-06-12 12:59:04 +0100 <mwseibel> A good angel investor writes a check and gets out of the way.  A great one can help you in a way that impacts the trajectory of your company.  There are very few great angel investors.  But almost all of them tell founders they are great.
1136637916233388032 2019-06-06 15:16:11 +0100 <mwseibel> It's hard to deal with the fear and emotional load that comes with being honest and receiving honesty in return.  But it's worth it to build a stronger and more trusting relationship moving forward.
1136637915667214337 2019-06-06 15:16:11 +0100 <mwseibel> When resolving a conflict with a coworker you admire and love to work with, honestly communicating your feelings/fears (and understanding/accepting their feelings) is so constructive.
1136340012625096705 2019-06-05 19:32:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Agreed - this is becoming a bigger trend in the investment community - which is great to see
1136290942191673345 2019-06-05 16:17:26 +0100 <mwseibel> No great product runs off of just 1 metric.
1136278323737141253 2019-06-05 15:27:18 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree - at YC we are going to think of some ways to set aside time for this purpose.
1136269378746322944 2019-06-05 14:51:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Agreed :)
1136269254041333761 2019-06-05 14:51:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Interestingly enough their tip was to just spend time thinking about it and you will figure out what changes to implement and what culture to create in order to make it happen.
1136264277210222592 2019-06-05 14:31:29 +0100 <mwseibel> To all startup founders out their: your startup might just be the most forceful thing you ever create.  Make sure it is a force for good.
1136264276211929088 2019-06-05 14:31:28 +0100 <mwseibel> They encouraged everyone in the room to think about this now when their company is small and easy to change.
1136264275272462338 2019-06-05 14:31:28 +0100 <mwseibel> The parting message that @bchesky and @jgebbia left to our founders last night was that they wished they put more thought into their vision for how Airbnb could help society 10 years ago when they were a small startup just entering YC.
1136264274467143680 2019-06-05 14:31:28 +0100 <mwseibel> There are YC companies now targeting fair access to education, affordable housing, criminal justice reform, access to government services, fair elections, and far more.
1136264273582145538 2019-06-05 14:31:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Many new YC founders over the past couple of years have started to create companies not just to become wealthy but to solve and important problems in the world.
1136264272814649344 2019-06-05 14:31:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Successful 21st century founders are realizing that their **company** will be the project that has the most impact on the world (not the foundation they run in their retirement) and they are starting to ask themselves if they like the impact their company is creating.
1136264271963181056 2019-06-05 14:31:27 +0100 <mwseibel> But there is a new view that is starting to take hold.  One where employees, customers, and society are seen as company stakeholders as well.
1136264271271096320 2019-06-05 14:31:27 +0100 <mwseibel> For many years CEOs have been solely accountable to their shareholders/investors.  This has caused them to let their products be used in ways that do not make the world a better place.
1136264270486810624 2019-06-05 14:31:27 +0100 <mwseibel> @bchesky and @jgebbia gave the first talk of the YC summer 2019 batch.  After telling the founding story of Airbnb - they shifted topics to talk about how companies should take a wider view of their purpose on earth.
1136264269811425281 2019-06-05 14:31:27 +0100 <mwseibel> There has been an iteration in YC‚Äôs culture over the past few years driven primary by our founders both new and old.  Last night was a special moment in that process.

1132466887252557824 2019-05-26 03:02:00 +0100 <mwseibel> The good old days.
1132447474239528961 2019-05-26 01:44:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Best answer ever!!!
1130906517069340680 2019-05-21 19:41:39 +0100 <mwseibel> We tried that.   http://Vote.org¬†
1130905715273605121 2019-05-21 19:38:28 +0100 <mwseibel> We funded a bunch of companies from India this and many of them are having problems getting visas.  Any ideas?
1130872756818579456 2019-05-21 17:27:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Super excited to announce the newest YC RFS.

1130519132762284037 2019-05-20 18:02:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Also thank you for all you've done for YC over the past 5 years.  There is no way we would be where we are today without you.
1130518829170249733 2019-05-20 18:01:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you Sam!  I hope you do great things with OpenAI!
1129452633306017792 2019-05-17 19:24:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Depends on your goal.  If your goal is to start a company in the next 1-2 years - I‚Äôd probably work at a startup instead of a FANG.
1129452414241714177 2019-05-17 19:23:34 +0100 <mwseibel> If you are interested in being a startup founder I‚Äôd probably work at an fairly early stage startup.
1129452176630198272 2019-05-17 19:22:37 +0100 <mwseibel> One technique I‚Äôve seen is to give small 4 year vesting stock grants every 6 months.  These does two things - makes it easier to spend more of your salary cause you see these grants as savings and makes you feel like you are throwing away your ‚Äúsavings account‚Äù by leaving.
1129450059739697152 2019-05-17 19:14:13 +0100 <mwseibel> What they don‚Äôt understand is that these big companies have a lot of techniques that make it difficult to leave once you join.
1129450058674364416 2019-05-17 19:14:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Many potential founders believe they need to get experience at FANG companies before starting their startup.
1129450057042866177 2019-05-17 19:14:12 +0100 <mwseibel> New video on how working at big tech companies can be a trap for future startup founders. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6amgO4dIotk¬†‚Ä¶
1129059952016863232 2019-05-16 17:24:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Whenever going up against an overpowered opponent (like the status quo of the US Government), I prefer to consider asymmetric tactics.
1129059951156969473 2019-05-16 17:24:03 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder how many other hacks to our current system exist that don‚Äôt require getting congress and the president to agree.  I wish there was as much information about to read about modern government hacks as there is about startup hacks.
1129059190356373504 2019-05-16 17:21:02 +0100 <mwseibel> It would be much better able to bring more electable candidates to the general election.
1129059189681082369 2019-05-16 17:21:02 +0100 <mwseibel> But primaries are regulated by political parties not the government.  Which ever party figured out how to reform its primary regime first would probably have a huge competive advantage.
1129058702877548544 2019-05-16 17:19:06 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs seems like primaries basically destroy the basic incentives for politicians to best serve their communities but forcing them to run to the extremes of their political parties.
1129058324928901120 2019-05-16 17:17:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Do the leaders of cities and states have any direct incentive to maintain or grow their populations?  Strangely in America, the primary system might give them incentive to do the opposite.  Coming from the startup world that feels backwards.
1127653558537445376 2019-05-12 20:15:33 +0100 <mwseibel> What triggers this change?
1127623388912951296 2019-05-12 18:15:40 +0100 <mwseibel> That‚Äôs interesting and makes sense.  Basically the entire HR system of leveling/promotions/bonuses is a way to motivate people regardless of the quality of their leaders...
1127620349342797825 2019-05-12 18:03:36 +0100 <mwseibel> That makes sense during the fast growth phase of a tech startup.  But I wonder how do you maintain that motivation 10+ years later when you have a dominant position in your market.
1127620013030952961 2019-05-12 18:02:15 +0100 <mwseibel> @justinkan @eshear told me about a conversation they had with @rabois years back.  The summary was that growth and product success helps create great culture and motivation.
1127616241470824448 2019-05-12 17:47:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly I‚Äôm not sure.  That‚Äôs a great question for the founders of @zapier and @gitlab.
1127615770668650496 2019-05-12 17:45:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Not enough talk about how motivational leaders can 10x the output of their entire organization.
1127615769305501697 2019-05-12 17:45:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Many people talk about 10x or 100x engineers.
1127615768072318976 2019-05-12 17:45:23 +0100 <mwseibel> I actually wonder how much a startup‚Äôs disruption of a big companies is simply powdered by the startup employees being more motivated.
1127615767145472000 2019-05-12 17:45:23 +0100 <mwseibel> I think I‚Äôve subconsciously known this since my first days as a startup CEO.  But not until a conversation with @justinkan yesterday did this idea really sink in.
1127614586650120192 2019-05-12 17:40:42 +0100 <mwseibel> That might work for a short while... but not long term.  Long term, organizations need leaders who can lead by example and who work hard everyday to motivate those around them.
1127614585706467328 2019-05-12 17:40:41 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder if they believe that motivation should just come from the employees themselves.
1127614584674590721 2019-05-12 17:40:41 +0100 <mwseibel> It surprises me how many leaders don‚Äôt want to engage in the practice of motivating their employees.
1127614583852560385 2019-05-12 17:40:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Motivation is the true multiplier on talent and hard work.  Even the most talented team will crawl without proper motivation.
1127614583168876544 2019-05-12 17:40:41 +0100 <mwseibel> But in practice managing the motivation of yourself, your cofounders, and your employees is probably more important.
1127614581759590401 2019-05-12 17:40:41 +0100 <mwseibel> At YC we emphasize product and customers a lot.
1127614580987912193 2019-05-12 17:40:40 +0100 <mwseibel> Organizing and motivating teams of people over a long period of time is one of the few things that separates good founders from great founders.

1123979745941704706 2019-05-02 16:57:08 +0100 <mwseibel> If they use the product and love it then they are almost always willing to pay if you ask them to.
1123612755682967552 2019-05-01 16:38:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Time to check Twitter this morning.  Which intelligent people are debating perceived slights and misinterpreting fact less commentary today?

1119680501479018498 2019-04-20 20:13:28 +0100 <mwseibel> First, specialized prep isn‚Äôt required.  Second, there is a ton of free material online including on our website and many alumni who help for free.  Third, it takes advantage of founders in a moment of vulnerability. Fourth, it can often be harmful to the startup if done poorly.
1119679337677172737 2019-04-20 20:08:51 +0100 <mwseibel> I apologize for this.  Unfortunately it‚Äôs really hard to give that feedback at scale and often it‚Äôs not actually the most useful thing to making your startup successful.  Keeping driving forward, talking to your users, and building what they want :)
1119677944656429058 2019-04-20 20:03:19 +0100 <mwseibel> There are over 4000 YC alumni - if a non-alum is asking for payment to help you with your application or interview prep.  Please contact an alum instead.  I‚Äôm sure if they have the time and you are polite they will be happy to help for free.
1119595283183276032 2019-04-20 14:34:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Needless to say - we don‚Äôt look kindly on this.
1119595281144778758 2019-04-20 14:34:50 +0100 <mwseibel> If you have seen anyone charging anything for YC application prep please let me know.  We have already gotten reports and we are following up with these people shortly...
1119376877146267648 2019-04-20 00:06:59 +0100 <mwseibel> You can find your group partners on bookface.
1119376723118891008 2019-04-20 00:06:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks for the suggestion - this exists!
1119376299674537985 2019-04-20 00:04:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Not under my watch they won‚Äôt - that‚Äôs bullshit
1119376208813277185 2019-04-20 00:04:19 +0100 <mwseibel> If anyone is asking for compensation of any sort for YC interview prep please email me: Michael@ycombinator.com

1119366315007987712 2019-04-19 23:25:00 +0100 <mwseibel> YC interview prep is starting to jump the shark a bit.  Please beware of snake oil salesmen.

1115268707964428290 2019-04-08 16:02:35 +0100 <mwseibel> You are incorrect.  We spend millions of dollars last year flying and housing companies for interviews.

1111825159088799746 2019-03-30 02:59:09 +0100 <mwseibel> New (old) trend.  Accelerators using exploding offers to force founders applying to YC to accept money before knowing whether they got in.  This is not founder friendly.  Founders accepted to YC have until the first day of the program to decide whether they want to participate.
1111362235803164672 2019-03-28 20:19:39 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you!
1111361694712762368 2019-03-28 20:17:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Do you know why this happens?
1111316977979539456 2019-03-28 17:19:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Of these number 3 is clearly the hardest.  By a mile.
1111299556707188736 2019-03-28 16:10:35 +0100 <mwseibel> How would that work?
1111298453944975366 2019-03-28 16:06:13 +0100 <mwseibel> Love this! https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1111287497538056192¬†‚Ä¶
1111298268992958465 2019-03-28 16:05:28 +0100 <mwseibel> I love online video infrastructure trivia!  It reminds me of my past life.

1109172207492595712 2019-03-22 19:17:16 +0100 <mwseibel> I ask because many founders worry that this is make work or an indication of a lack of interest in their company.
1109172206192332800 2019-03-22 19:17:16 +0100 <mwseibel> I understand why this is something that a Series A investor wants and a Series B/C investor should demand.  But how often does this actually make a difference in the super early stage?
1109172203881291776 2019-03-22 19:17:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Honest question for early stage investors (angels/funds).  Why would you ask an early stage company (just launched and certainly pre-product market fit) for a detailed business plan?  I‚Äôm talking about financial projections, hiring plan, expenses plan, product milestones.

1108834516875927552 2019-03-21 20:55:24 +0100 <mwseibel> I love this advice!!!
1108834047927554048 2019-03-21 20:53:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Our advice to founders in this situation is to be upfront and ask if the investor thinks there is a conflict.
1108834046476337152 2019-03-21 20:53:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Getting a lot of YC founders telling me that firms who have invested in competitors are proactively reaching out and asking for a deck.  I didn‚Äôt realize this was as common as it is turning out to be.
1108720864399253506 2019-03-21 13:23:47 +0100 <mwseibel> I guess we have different experience.
1108429665759195136 2019-03-20 18:06:40 +0100 <mwseibel> I love his but I would add the tax man.  Also I‚Äôd add a side note that this assumes a single investment fund which isn‚Äôt true so the partner return numbers are most likely lower.
1108358693945397253 2019-03-20 13:24:39 +0100 <mwseibel> Most YC startups die because they don‚Äôt find product market fit.  Some die because they spend too much while hunting for product market fit.  I think $1.5m (if spent wisely) is enough money for many pure software startups to figure out if they have something.
1108356753706487808 2019-03-20 13:16:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Sorry about that.  New venue.  We‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs better for next time :)
1108351414646915073 2019-03-20 12:55:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Drop me an email - michael@ycombinator.com
1108224240723976193 2019-03-20 04:30:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes of course.  But I think not finding product market is the biggest killer of startups and investment is one of the best ways to give you the runway to find product market fit along with low spending and generating revenue.  In general high runway and low dilution are good.
1108216588690325504 2019-03-20 03:59:59 +0100 <mwseibel> I guest you‚Äôre not special unless you think that you are special.  Those emails are accurate.
1108216429344489473 2019-03-20 03:59:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I think there is a lot of real value in getting the resources you need to fund your company while reducing dilution to the founders.
1108185611913973760 2019-03-20 01:56:53 +0100 <mwseibel> Increase in valuation you get in future funding rounds.
1108174195198836736 2019-03-20 01:11:31 +0100 <mwseibel> Totally fair :)
1108170440533381120 2019-03-20 00:56:36 +0100 <mwseibel> I will agree with you though that companies who do YC have an advantage at fundraising.  With that advantage alone participating in YC pays for itself.  But I would argue that these are very talented founders.  We accepted only ~200 companies out of 12000 companies who applied.
1108169542625165312 2019-03-20 00:53:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Most YC companies do not raise at these valuations.  The ones who do are able to because of high *investor* demand.  Also, we have companies at many different stages both pre and post revenue.  It‚Äôs really hard to observe overall batch trends when there are 200 companies.
1108165947800449024 2019-03-20 00:38:45 +0100 <mwseibel> What would you like to know?

1106957333601542150 2019-03-16 16:36:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I appreciate the comment.  Reach out to me over email and I‚Äôd be happy to discuss in more detail.  I actually think it‚Äôs in the investors best interest to use YC docs and not just for speed.  I‚Äôm at michael@ycombinator.com
1106955305626169344 2019-03-16 16:28:05 +0100 <mwseibel> This technique doesn‚Äôt have a high rate of success and optimizes for putting money into the hands of the outsourcers.
1106703632563474433 2019-03-15 23:48:02 +0100 <mwseibel> It would be helpful if demo day investors remember that at YC we have standard investment paperwork.  Using our paperwork makes deals close faster and enables you to build trust with our companies.
1106650626614685696 2019-03-15 20:17:24 +0100 <mwseibel> Be careful when an investor is telling you exactly what you want to hear.  It might feel good but make sure you understand their intentions/motivations.
1106650624886603776 2019-03-15 20:17:24 +0100 <mwseibel> The number of YC founders who reach out to me years after their batch and say they wish they had stayed closer to YC, their group partners, and their batchmates is through the roof.
1106650624370720768 2019-03-15 20:17:24 +0100 <mwseibel> In the YC case specifically - its to convince founders they have graduated from YC and now it's time for them to get the grown up advice from more "important" investors/firms.
1106650623640887296 2019-03-15 20:17:23 +0100 <mwseibel> The easiest way to do that (and most disastrous) is to convince the founders they already have product market fit and need a lot of money when they don't.
1106650622730727425 2019-03-15 20:17:23 +0100 <mwseibel> One trick that investors use to get founders to take their money is to make the founders feel cool.

1100420165437599750 2019-02-26 15:39:46 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder if 10-20 year from now the social media fix will appear similar to fixing email spam.
1100125171120103424 2019-02-25 20:07:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Investors who tell founders where to build their company...  YC companies come to the Bay Area for 3 months but then they choose where they want to build their companies.  If investors know where/how the next consumer products will be built, why don‚Äôt they quit VC and build them?
1100124350877917186 2019-02-25 20:04:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats :)
1098980181191155714 2019-02-22 16:17:47 +0100 <mwseibel> I try not to kill entrepreneurs.
1098605756373454849 2019-02-21 15:29:58 +0100 <mwseibel> YC Startup School had 23,000 participants last year (the majority of whom were from outside of the US). We believe our accelerator should stay in the Bay Area because we want to give founders from around the world access to this special community.  https://www.startupschool.org/¬†
1097514959309684738 2019-02-18 15:15:31 +0100 <mwseibel> If someone wants to accomplish the same ends as I do but through different means...  I believe we are on the same team and we can find a why to compromise and find the means that satisfy both of us.  I‚Äôm not sure the reverse is true.
1097514957631942656 2019-02-18 15:15:31 +0100 <mwseibel> If these three groups on the left worked together (instead of fighting all the time) and applied our minds to government reform, it would be very interesting what solutions we would come up with.
1097514954389778432 2019-02-18 15:15:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Startup folks are good at finding hacks - solutions where 10% of the work produces 90% of the result.  Those who have worked in government (or who lobby the government) understand its hidden mechanics.  Activists are great at rallying people to new causes.
1097514952753987584 2019-02-18 15:15:30 +0100 <mwseibel> The true question is how we accomplish these ends.  Instead of attacking each other - we should be having a positive debate about the different methods to achieve these goals.
1097514951025909760 2019-02-18 15:15:29 +0100 <mwseibel> The reason why is that we actually agree on ends (better/cheaper heathcare, better education, less pollution, campaign finance reform, housing reform, criminal justice reform, social safety net, immigration reform, minority civil rights, etc).
1097514949679624192 2019-02-18 15:15:29 +0100 <mwseibel> When the left and the far left fight they almost always debate means as opposed to ends.
1096496310226608129 2019-02-15 19:47:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol - still trying to figure out how to become one.
1096436633648324609 2019-02-15 15:50:38 +0100 <mwseibel> People talk about 10x engineers a lot (and they should - they are extremely valuable).  They don‚Äôt talk enough about 10x leaders.  Leaders who can get 10x more out of the people they work with over time. That is truly an amazing skill and much more rare than a 10x engineer.
1096436632809435136 2019-02-15 15:50:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Founders and managers should be hyper sensitive to motivation.  Often your actions/example in the workplace effect motivation far more than you might realize.
1096436631513358339 2019-02-15 15:50:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Motivation is often the difference between a C work product and an A work product.
1096436630347407360 2019-02-15 15:50:38 +0100 <mwseibel> When I was young I thought management was about distribution/delegation of responsibilities.  I now realize it is truly about the maintenance of morale and motivation.  Morale and motivation are moving targets that require consistent and proactive effort to maintain.

1085603994414665728 2019-01-16 18:25:36 +0100 <mwseibel> :( there isn‚Äôt
1085577322198065152 2019-01-16 16:39:37 +0100 <mwseibel> And usually the result is that some class of people get more rights, representation, visibly, and power.
1085577321413636096 2019-01-16 16:39:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Whenever culture changes people use slippery slope arguments to warn that we should return to the old ways.  The funny thing is that those arguments almost never actually change things back (in America).  Society changes and everyone adjusts to the new norms.
1085577320532852737 2019-01-16 16:39:36 +0100 <mwseibel> So in conclusion: I think this was probably a good business decision.  I also think that if this ad represents the political/moral views of the company it is great that they are making those views more public.
1085577319761104896 2019-01-16 16:39:36 +0100 <mwseibel> 5) The culture is changing and as women are more empowered, media is going to change as well.  This is a good and natural thing!
1085577318553145344 2019-01-16 16:39:36 +0100 <mwseibel> 4) Younger generations want to support companies that support the causes they believe in.  See Nike.  The days of the completely apolitical consumer company might be coming to an end (for better or for worse).
1085577316573446146 2019-01-16 16:39:35 +0100 <mwseibel> 3) I don‚Äôt think most men believe that it is bad to break up fights, stop your friend from catcalling a women, or not put down a women in the workplace.  These were the types of actions displayed in the ad.
1085577315176767488 2019-01-16 16:39:35 +0100 <mwseibel> 2) In many married households, women do most of the household shopping.
1085577314157584384 2019-01-16 16:39:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Some things to consider.  1) Lots of women buy razors and many buy ‚Äúmen‚Äôs razors‚Äù.  Pissing of ~10% of dudes to appeal to 70%+ of women might be a smart move.
1085577312102281216 2019-01-16 16:39:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Starting obligatory tweet on Gillette ad:  some people are trying to explain why the ad is causing some to have a negative response.  I think the more interesting question is regardless of the negative response was this a good ad to run? Will it result in more sales?

1079832943269302272 2018-12-31 20:13:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you :)
1075703642471096320 2018-12-20 10:45:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Keep in mind the goal of the campaign finance amendment would be to prevent all companies and individuals from donating to campaigns and prevent them from launching their own campaigns in support of a candidate.
1075703640428441602 2018-12-20 10:45:08 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôd hope for the former but assume some would fear the latter.
1075703638125760517 2018-12-20 10:45:07 +0100 <mwseibel> result in more fair elections with higher quality candidates or with more celebrity/populist candidates who are even less engaged with the issues that confront America today?
1075703634527047681 2018-12-20 10:45:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Question: Would aggressive campaign finance reform (constitutional amendment prohibiting all political donations, all political advertising not created by a registered campaigns, and publicly funding all federal elections)...
1075700189476773889 2018-12-20 10:31:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Supreme Court helped us out with a couple more big wins.
1075699908806610945 2018-12-20 10:30:18 +0100 <mwseibel> I worry that we‚Äôve been fighting for 35 years and all we got out of it (from our elected officials) was Obamacare.
1075686451608616960 2018-12-20 09:36:50 +0100 <mwseibel> By this I mean / how are we leveraging our general agreement to get laws passed?
1075685582750150657 2018-12-20 09:33:22 +0100 <mwseibel> I think we probably already have enough general agreement on single payer healthcare option (Medicare expansion), criminal justice reform,  and immigration reform.  What are we doing with that?
1075685051654799360 2018-12-20 09:31:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Moving the goal posts is a easy way to declare victory.  I used to be that passing universal healthcare was the goal.  Now the goal is to get our politicians to talk about universal healthcare.  That‚Äôs not great progress.
1075678280836046848 2018-12-20 09:04:21 +0100 <mwseibel> What is the thing (or set of things) that the far left needs to convince the left of in order for us to transition to working together to enact change?
1075676343918944256 2018-12-20 08:56:40 +0100 <mwseibel> The left is neither disrupting nor shutting the system down.  Even if I agreed that this was victory - we aren‚Äôt winning at this.
1075674058434334720 2018-12-20 08:47:35 +0100 <mwseibel> I actually think many of the debates on the left drive disengagement.  It‚Äôs easier to not engage then to be told that you‚Äôre not liberal enough.
1075673666820628482 2018-12-20 08:46:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Also - what is more important - moving the conversation or doubling down on the things we believe in and actually making them happen?
1075673336896614401 2018-12-20 08:44:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Is there a point where we fight so hard and so much that we actually don‚Äôt want to hang out with each other enough to pass laws and elect politicians?
1075672985590087682 2018-12-20 08:43:19 +0100 <mwseibel> If I don‚Äôt understand this and I‚Äôm a member of the left, does that mean something is wrong with me or does that mean that this strategy isn‚Äôt working?
1075669922355720192 2018-12-20 08:31:09 +0100 <mwseibel> Not incorruptible - just not requiring corporate donations in order to run their campaign.
1075669285861638144 2018-12-20 08:28:37 +0100 <mwseibel> I don‚Äôt think this is obvious to most people on the left but I think it‚Äôs 100% correct.  Campaigns play by the rules they are provided.  When everyone is playing by the same rules and you lose you can‚Äôt complain that the rules should have been different.
1075668690006245376 2018-12-20 08:26:15 +0100 <mwseibel> What‚Äôs interesting about virtue signaling is that if you live in a liberal urban area and have a good job - it‚Äôs the easiest way to feel like you are making a difference without actually making a difference.
1075668104321982464 2018-12-20 08:23:55 +0100 <mwseibel> That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at at.  I‚Äôm saying issue by issue either the left or the far left should compromise.  The beltway Democrats aren‚Äôt in power because the Democrats aren‚Äôt united.  These elected leaders are like the Stewards in the Lord of the Rings.
1075666052896284673 2018-12-20 08:15:46 +0100 <mwseibel> If it turns out that the left has to be 2x more organized than the right to accomplish their goals... that is a high bar.
1075666051826778112 2018-12-20 08:15:46 +0100 <mwseibel> One thought that comes to mind is perhaps change requires more organization than status quo.  So if both parties are equally good at organizing - the Republicans win.
1075664851551248385 2018-12-20 08:11:00 +0100 <mwseibel> One theory is that the left leaning media is the grand unifier.  No one likes to being told they are bad everyday.
1075664540644196352 2018-12-20 08:09:46 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree but I‚Äôm not sure what makes the right a more solid bloc.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because they actually all agree with each other on policy.  There is a lot for monied pro-choice urbanites, rural Bible Belt voters, and law and order suburbanites to disagree about.
1075663618526433280 2018-12-20 08:06:06 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree that corporate interests are powerful and well organized and funded.  But I actually believe a well organized left could defeat them easily.  Not many business could survive a boycott from the left and their are rich potential politicians who don‚Äôt need corporate money.
1075662944539570177 2018-12-20 08:03:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Progress towards equality of opportunity.
1075660676448669696 2018-12-20 07:54:24 +0100 <mwseibel> This sounds right on first read but I‚Äôm actually not sure it‚Äôs true.  What causes you to believe this?
1075660085500604416 2018-12-20 07:52:03 +0100 <mwseibel> I would argue this is a result of the left being miss organized.  If you look at opinion polls on many of the tent pole issues that democrats support - they have the majority of the population most of the time.
1075659615692419072 2018-12-20 07:50:11 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree.  But status quo is often a win for the right.  So perhaps their disagreement isn‚Äôt harmful to their strategy as ours?
1075659300272463872 2018-12-20 07:48:56 +0100 <mwseibel> How do we bring about change if we can‚Äôt get the Clinton wing and the Sanders wing to work together?  We can re-examine all day long but without a coalition we cannot get laws passed.
1075658901117259777 2018-12-20 07:47:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôd argue that America is actually center left but the left just cannot get organized.  I wonder what is causing you to believe we are center right?
1075658530026188800 2018-12-20 07:45:52 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the tone of the debates scares a lot of capable people away from politics instead of inspiring more people to want to engage.
1075657822321299456 2018-12-20 07:43:04 +0100 <mwseibel> I don‚Äôt understand your point.  You mean the left fighting amongst itself is bad for the right?
1075656134625611777 2018-12-20 07:36:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Is there any other strategy that will work?  Happy to hear your thoughts.
1075656133057032192 2018-12-20 07:36:21 +0100 <mwseibel> How bad will things have to get before we on the left put away our differences and compromise for the common good?
1075656132134297600 2018-12-20 07:36:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôm starting to believe that the Republican era that started with Reagan and has continued to this day is far more the fault of the left‚Äôs lack of unity than the right‚Äôs amazing tactics.
1075656129781235712 2018-12-20 07:36:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Is there much value in winning a debate, being ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù, putting someone else down, or being the most woke if the country is crumbling all around us?
1075656127524724738 2018-12-20 07:36:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Any idea why we (the left) do this?  Seems like in order to progress we need to compromise and consensus build, but today these actions are most likely to get you attacked.
1075656126270660608 2018-12-20 07:36:19 +0100 <mwseibel> More and more often I see the left and the far left fighting against each other.  This is a huge win for the right...

1062087827981127686 2018-11-12 21:00:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Being a jerk is bad - I agree. But confusing being direct for being a jerk also bad right?

1062039805020663808 2018-11-12 17:49:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Being in the receiving side of this style of advice giving can be very challenging.  But there is so much gold here that for me it is worth the pain.
1062039803678535681 2018-11-12 17:49:55 +0100 <mwseibel> This is one of the core tenants of YC.  To be honest and direct with our founders.  Not to be hurtful, but to push them to confront the real problems in whatever they are trying to do.
1062039802432827392 2018-11-12 17:49:55 +0100 <mwseibel> I *think* the reason why they were able to give great advice was that they were confident in themselves, were sincere in wanting to help us, and really didn‚Äôt give a shit if we thought they were mean or rude.
1062039800012713984 2018-11-12 17:49:54 +0100 <mwseibel> I can honestly say that without their advice Twitch would never exist.
1062039798427185152 2018-11-12 17:49:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Two people who did this for us at  http://Justin.tv¬† /  http://Twitch.tv¬† were Paul Buchheit @paultoo and Gideon Yu @gideonyu (of course there were many more)
1062039797722562560 2018-11-12 17:49:54 +0100 <mwseibel> But some investors actually tell you the real deal with direct and clear language.  As a founder - that is what I needed to hear.
1062039796619431936 2018-11-12 17:49:53 +0100 <mwseibel> ... So they tend to be very cautious and often they don‚Äôt tell you what they are really thinking at all.
1062039795608694785 2018-11-12 17:49:53 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the reason why was that I often asked investors for advice and they have mixed motivations.  They never want to burn a bridge that can prevent them for getting access to a good investment...
1062039793813532673 2018-11-12 17:49:53 +0100 <mwseibel> When I first came out to the valley I asked a lot of people for advice on how to make my startup great.  What I got was a lot of luke warm, overly nice, and not very useful guidance.  (YC was the exception)
1062039790210768897 2018-11-12 17:49:52 +0100 <mwseibel> When I talk to founders often I am very very direct and that can come off as inconsiderate.  This is not my intention...
1062035986916368384 2018-11-12 17:34:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Me being motivated to not make as many mistakes later in my career.  Most founders have to learn from their own mistakes.  I think great founders tend to learn faster than I did.
1062024540786581512 2018-11-12 16:49:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Seems like I‚Äôd be a better expert in my mistakes than others right?
1062007361034801153 2018-11-12 15:41:00 +0100 <mwseibel> We broke them in the beginning and almost died 5 times.  We had gamers on our site for 5 years before we talked to them.  Twitch could have happened much sooner if we actually followed some basic YC advice.
1061835388614959106 2018-11-12 04:17:39 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing that grinds my gears is when **early stage** startup co-founders aren't transparent with each other about the financial health of the business.  Even better - be transparent with your employees.
1060352919478841345 2018-11-08 02:06:51 +0100 <mwseibel> We accepted a founder today whose first email to me was 3 years ago.  Crazy!  I'm so excited for him.

1058729049848082437 2018-11-03 14:34:10 +0100 <mwseibel> West Wing Quote of the Day: Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." - Margaret Mead
1058037172811395072 2018-11-01 16:44:54 +0100 <mwseibel> West Wing Quote of the Day: "There‚Äôs a Wilson quote: ‚ÄúIs the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace or for a new balance of power?There must be not a balance of power but a community of power. Not organized rivalries but an organized common peace.‚Äù"
1058035928726364161 2018-11-01 16:39:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Im gonna need you to apologize - STAT!
1058028764800540673 2018-11-01 16:11:29 +0100 <mwseibel> If you know a former Life Sciences founder please let them know that this fall YC is hiring a Visiting Partner for Life Sciences.  Here are more details about the role:   https://jobs.lever.co/ycombinator/8b3e7965-e86c-4ba6-b1e9-1d64b3c555bf¬†‚Ä¶
1058026222398001152 2018-11-01 16:01:23 +0100 <mwseibel> If you are trying to access money from the tech startup community - one cheat code is to hold this more expansive view of how tech can help you build a great business...
1058026220422459392 2018-11-01 16:01:22 +0100 <mwseibel> I see tech as replacing the whole toolbox with a better one.  It can inform so many areas that are traditional seen as purely business tasks (branding, marketing, sales, customer research, etc)...
1058026219218685952 2018-11-01 16:01:22 +0100 <mwseibel> There is an interesting trend I see amongst a small but growing set of founders.  Instead of actively reaching for technology in order to make their business better they see tech as just one tool in a large tool box, to be selected only when needed...

1057286587845959681 2018-10-30 15:02:20 +0100 <mwseibel> We always take late apps.
1057286516441964544 2018-10-30 15:02:03 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs the 27th time we‚Äôve done admissions at YC.  We are pretty good at it.
1057286364260052992 2018-10-30 15:01:27 +0100 <mwseibel> That is not how the admissions process works.  Every application is considered and if we need to add interview slots in order to interview all the ones we like than we do.
1057029794469097472 2018-10-29 22:01:56 +0100 <mwseibel> You should always try to learn from your mistakes but over learning / over correcting can cause just as many problems as not learning at all.
1057029792267026432 2018-10-29 22:01:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Instead next time, consider being smarter about choosing a cofounder who is the right fit for you...
1057029791369486336 2018-10-29 22:01:55 +0100 <mwseibel> You shouldn‚Äôt just default to starting your next company as a solo founder...
1057029790341914624 2018-10-29 22:01:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Specific application - if your last startup had a bunch of cofounder conflict that ultimately led to a poor outcome...
1057029787850498049 2018-10-29 22:01:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Important lesson.  Don‚Äôt over learn from your previous mistakes.

1052594263291191298 2018-10-17 17:16:43 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree something we might dive into in the 2019 list :)
1052594158454497280 2018-10-17 17:16:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Engineers interested in working for a YC top 100 startup should consider applying at  https://workatastartup.com/¬†.

1052592497413636098 2018-10-17 17:09:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Fun facts: The top 100 companies have created over 28,000 jobs. Of the companies that are valued at over $1B, you'll see a variety of sectors. 5 companies valued at over $1B were funded by YC in the last 5 years. 48 companies on the list were funded by YC in the last 5 years.

1049376388942155776 2018-10-08 20:10:02 +0100 <mwseibel> The YC Hackathon was really great this weekend.  I enjoyed staying late and talking to participants and I look forward to the next one.

1049375664682328064 2018-10-08 20:07:09 +0100 <mwseibel> So I get an email newsletter everyday from YCs internal social network.

1047883547208376320 2018-10-04 17:18:01 +0100 <mwseibel> I assume many of these are YC companies.  If so please encourage them to post in the investor database if they haven't already.  I think investors build their true reputation you observe their actions in high leverage moments.
1047882741398687750 2018-10-04 17:14:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Here is how I think about it:  https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-pitch-your-company/¬†‚Ä¶.  Too often when founders start with the problem it turns into a 5 minutes story that is hard to follow.  In my mind the problem should be self evident in the 2-3 sentence description of what you do.
1047340351696990208 2018-10-03 05:19:33 +0100 <mwseibel> congrats :)
1047340192225357824 2018-10-03 05:18:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Well a lot of companies have applied to YC for the w19 batch.  Now it's time to read applications.  BTW - if you are a little late with your app (24-48 hrs) - don't worry just submit it.  @Airbnb was a late applicant and look how they turned out :)

1046520798788247552 2018-09-30 23:02:56 +0100 <mwseibel> They can be impactful on the margins - but getting a bunch of recs from people you don't know is a waste of time.
1046520449314648066 2018-09-30 23:01:33 +0100 <mwseibel> sure - but dont need to
1046519225647415296 2018-09-30 22:56:41 +0100 <mwseibel> All applications are read by humans.
1046517400915460096 2018-09-30 22:49:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Strangely the easier we make it to apply to YC the more founders want to take us out to dinner/lunch/coffee etc.  The whole point of YC is that you don't have to network your way in.  All you have to do is fill out and application.  And unlike dinner - an application is free!
1046514825403105280 2018-09-30 22:39:12 +0100 <mwseibel> This is a bad way to ask for advice over a cold email: describe what your company does, send a link, and then say "any feedback and/or advice is greatly appreciated".  Here is a better way: http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
1046509877999226880 2018-09-30 22:19:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Agreed!
1046506387449077760 2018-09-30 22:05:40 +0100 <mwseibel> Be careful with advisors who aren't willing to invest and who want a large chunk of your startup (above .5%)...
1046491300076249088 2018-09-30 21:05:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly - its so rare that it just makes to apply.  Literally there is no cost to applying and just filling out the application is actually helpful to your startup.
1046488183070814208 2018-09-30 20:53:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Most common question I get: Is YC a good fit for my startup?  Most common answer: Yes!

1045306352241786880 2018-09-27 14:37:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree.  I wish more people didn‚Äôt feel the need to get an intro.  It holds people back.  Strangely I‚Äôve seen the intro give the email sender confidence as much or even more often than give the receiver social proof.

1043900582791012354 2018-09-23 17:31:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Look at the companies that have participated
1043894886510952448 2018-09-23 17:08:30 +0100 <mwseibel> 5) Remember that startup accelerators are not like universities.  There isn't much of a difference between the top 10 universities.  There is a huge difference between the top 10 accelerators.  Absolutely massive!  Below is YC's record: pic.twitter.com/eSNBPAgYix
1043894884602540032 2018-09-23 17:08:29 +0100 <mwseibel> 4) Remember if they are using high pressure sales tactics is it an accelerator you really want to be a part of?  Every YC company has until the first day of the program to accept our investment offer.
1043894883939803136 2018-09-23 17:08:29 +0100 <mwseibel> 3) Ask the other accelerator for the option to defer.
1043894882132156418 2018-09-23 17:08:29 +0100 <mwseibel> 2) Don't accept the other accelerator's offer and learn from the content in the Startup School library:  https://www.startupschool.org/library¬† and/or audit Startup School:  https://www.startupschool.org/latest¬† for FREE.
1043894880781496320 2018-09-23 17:08:28 +0100 <mwseibel> 1) Tell the accelerator you want to wait until you hear from YC.  YC Interview invitations are sent on Oct 23rd.
1043894880106307584 2018-09-23 17:08:28 +0100 <mwseibel> If you have gotten into another accelerator but want to wait for YC here are some tactics you can try:
1043892344313995264 2018-09-23 16:58:24 +0100 <mwseibel> I feel less like this when the startup asks a very specific question or presents and interesting problem that perhaps my experience at YC or at my own startups would provide a unique perspective.
1043892342627790849 2018-09-23 16:58:23 +0100 <mwseibel> On one hand I want to be helpful and I always reply to their emails offering the same advice I would give to a YC company.  On the other hand I want to say "go make your existing accelerator work for the 7% they took!"
1043892341029761024 2018-09-23 16:58:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Is it really a competitor to YC if they can't help with the basics and/or their demo day doesn't help you raise money?  Seems like these things should be a basic part of the core definition of a startup accelerator.
1043892340274819072 2018-09-23 16:58:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Not sure what I'm supposed to think when companies who go to "competing" startup accelerators email asking for basic startup advice and/or how to get into YC.
1043535014405660672 2018-09-22 17:18:30 +0100 <mwseibel> One counterintuitive thought is that unfortunately your company might be worse off if you attend a low quality startup accelerator/incubator.  Bad advice is worse than no advice at all.  And there is a lot of good advice free online:  https://www.startupschool.org/library¬†
1043535013659066368 2018-09-22 17:18:29 +0100 <mwseibel> I feel for founders who are in this situation because I understand the YC acceptance rate is fairly low...
1043535011159265280 2018-09-22 17:18:29 +0100 <mwseibel> It's as if Yale thought they couldn't get good applicants unless they had an admissions deadline 6 months before Harvard...
1043535009317965824 2018-09-22 17:18:28 +0100 <mwseibel> A lot of founders think that it is best to take the bird in the hand.  I'm just not sure why someone would want to participate in a program that was expressly designed in this way...
1043535008202285056 2018-09-22 17:18:28 +0100 <mwseibel> A number of startup accelerators/incubators put founders in a tough bind.  They specifically run their admissions process right before YC's and force founders to accept admission before knowing whether they've gotten into YC...
1043328768478142464 2018-09-22 03:38:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Boom! Camp YC (our annual YC reunion) begins!
1043136126796451847 2018-09-21 14:53:27 +0100 <mwseibel> Why not start a company of your own?
1042900974271049728 2018-09-20 23:19:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Early Decision - a new process for college seniors who are considering applying to YC - https://blog.ycombinator.com/early-decision/¬†
1041263835632623617 2018-09-16 10:53:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Goodbye Boston/NewYork - amazing trip.  Had so much fun hanging with alumni in NYC and met some really great founders in Boston.  Certainly I‚Äôll be seeing some of them in YC next batch.
1040574614068502528 2018-09-14 13:14:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Tomorrow headed to HackMIT.  Going to talk to some future founders and embarrass my little brother who is a junior there :)
1040574611581296640 2018-09-14 13:14:54 +0100 <mwseibel> One day/night in NYC.  Super excited to be visiting: @ArthenaArt, @AptDeco, @hiburrow, @kidpass, @wayup, @eightsleep, @getsquire, @RentRezi, and @Scentbird.  #YCNYC
1040459067074895872 2018-09-14 05:35:47 +0100 <mwseibel> @robreich care to follow so I can send you a DM?
1040395374442283008 2018-09-14 01:22:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Boom!
1040395087958568960 2018-09-14 01:21:33 +0100 <mwseibel> Already had founders from your event email me with positive feedback.  Thanks!
1040326378028072960 2018-09-13 20:48:31 +0100 <mwseibel> thanks!
1040316352332849154 2018-09-13 20:08:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Excited that we are doing more Hackathons at YC! If you are interested apply to attend. https://twitter.com/ycombinator/status/1039886666222235649¬†‚Ä¶
1040315704103198721 2018-09-13 20:06:06 +0100 <mwseibel> !!! blast from the past :) Thanks!
1040026168131371008 2018-09-13 00:55:35 +0100 <mwseibel> I love those days when you have a super productive meeting and really move your company forward.  This is so rare cause many meetings are a waste of time.  But at today‚Äôs YC partner meeting, I think we hit multiple homeruns. pic.twitter.com/KNGLIVGZU4
1039701840433012736 2018-09-12 03:26:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Most YC companies haven‚Äôt really figured out their option pool by demo day.  This is something we are thinking about adding to onboarding in the beginning of the batch. We agree that companies should be more generous with options to early employees.
1039510910610550785 2018-09-11 14:48:08 +0100 <mwseibel> #firstbeliever
1039509860423880707 2018-09-11 14:43:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks for the note but we don‚Äôt have a journalist database.  Not even sure what we would use that for.
1039509549604958209 2018-09-11 14:42:44 +0100 <mwseibel> What are you referring to?
1039369823283638273 2018-09-11 05:27:31 +0100 <mwseibel> PS:  if you don‚Äôt know best practices - here is a guide: https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/startup-investor-school/¬†‚Ä¶
1039369822109237248 2018-09-11 05:27:30 +0100 <mwseibel> And if you see a founder not acting correctly - please email me and I‚Äôll be happy to reach out to them.  Michael@ycombinator.com
1039369820779601920 2018-09-11 05:27:30 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs a small community.  We tell our founders to be polite, respectful of your time, and follow industry best practices.  Investors please follow the same advice.  We are watching.
1039369819752001536 2018-09-11 05:27:30 +0100 <mwseibel> 4) It‚Äôs often told to fellow batchmates...
1039369818523152384 2018-09-11 05:27:29 +0100 <mwseibel> 3) It‚Äôs communicated to YC legal team so that they can advise the company on how to respond
1039369817461932032 2018-09-11 05:27:29 +0100 <mwseibel> 2) It‚Äôs written up in the YC investor database for future YC founders to read
1039369813951311872 2018-09-11 05:27:28 +0100 <mwseibel> 1) YC Partners are told immediately (we have a WhatsApp group with every single company)
1039369812827230209 2018-09-11 05:27:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Investors in YC companies please remember.  When you make extremely non-standard complicated requests, waste founder time, don‚Äôt follow handshake deals, take forever to wire money, or otherwise screw around with a YC company during fundraising the following happens:
1039356256819900416 2018-09-11 04:33:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Boom!
1039158740165877760 2018-09-10 15:28:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Boom! https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1039155806472523776¬†‚Ä¶
1038984509742444544 2018-09-10 03:56:25 +0100 <mwseibel> ... if you want money - just ask for it!
1038915766278471682 2018-09-09 23:23:15 +0100 <mwseibel> The majority of questions I receive are already addressed in blog posts online by people far smarter than me and in much more depth than I am able to provide over email.
1038915765393477632 2018-09-09 23:23:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Tip to founders emailing for advice: Start with a google search and/or the following sites:   https://www.startupschool.org/library¬†,  http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html¬†,  https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/advice/¬†‚Ä¶,  https://blog.ycombinator.com/category/essay/¬†, and  https://pmarchive.com/¬†
1038852172245491712 2018-09-09 19:10:33 +0100 <mwseibel> ... if I were you and these things have been slowing you down for months - i'd consider changing your plan.  Not your market/customer/solution - just your plan.
1038852171368779776 2018-09-09 19:10:33 +0100 <mwseibel> One startup hint: if you are a first time founder it's a lot harder get forward momentum if the first step of your plan requires a big biz dev deal, a big enterprise contract, a large investment, or some other massive challenge.  It can be done but its hard...
1038829671909974016 2018-09-09 17:41:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Angel funds yes
1038823984647700480 2018-09-09 17:18:33 +0100 <mwseibel> ... and you figure out which angels are interested in your industry.  Getting what amounts to a cold intro from me isn't really needed.  Write a great short email and email the angel directly.  You'll be surprised by your success rate :) https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-email-early-stage-investors/¬†‚Ä¶
1038823983783657472 2018-09-09 17:18:32 +0100 <mwseibel> For all founders who email me for intros to any angel investors I might know who are interested in X...  There are over 50,000 angel investors who have invested in YC companies.  Instead of asking me to do research for you, take a look at crunchbase, angel list, etc...
1038818564071772160 2018-09-09 16:57:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you :)
1038554654391513088 2018-09-08 23:28:19 +0100 <mwseibel> I think working in industry is the fastest and most effective way.
1038554521977290752 2018-09-08 23:27:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Code Academy is a good place to start (Also I‚Äôd do a google search)
1038552996596998144 2018-09-08 23:21:44 +0100 <mwseibel> @operaqueenie I‚Äôm going to stop here.  I think we are both trying to help people succeed and we should working together. Thank you for motivating me to post advice for non-tech founders because they reach out to me all the time with their challenges.  Have a good weekend :)
1038552034264248320 2018-09-08 23:17:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Alright - I‚Äôm going to stop here.  I think we are both trying to help people to succeed in the world so there is no reason for us to be arguing.
1038551227112407040 2018-09-08 23:14:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Check my twitter feed - I wrote about how this morning
1038548867732537346 2018-09-08 23:05:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Think about if I were pitching you and your were the investor.  Would you write a check?  Especially with a slew of highly technical teams pitching you everyday?
1038548607572434944 2018-09-08 23:04:18 +0100 <mwseibel> You can‚Äôt change the color of your skin but you can learn new skills and / or become friends with new people right?
1038548489863450624 2018-09-08 23:03:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Also I don‚Äôt think learning to code or meeting software engineers is as structural of a challenge as other challenges like racism.
1038548104230752256 2018-09-08 23:02:17 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly I think NBA is also a great analogy because even though it‚Äôs very hard to succeed.  It‚Äôs not impossible to learn the rules of basketball and start.  I think of tech the same way.
1038547815788494848 2018-09-08 23:01:09 +0100 <mwseibel> That is totally true.  I think the NBA is a great analogy to tech startups.  No one would ever tell their kids to expect to make it to the NBA.  But if that is their life‚Äôs passion - people around them should try to help.
1038504085970767872 2018-09-08 20:07:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Welp - my advice is for you then
1038503324088131586 2018-09-08 20:04:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Do you want to raise money?
1038462044280778753 2018-09-08 17:20:19 +0100 <mwseibel> I want them to impact the world and make it a better place through tech - which is the most scaleable way to turn effort into impact.
1038461890085539840 2018-09-08 17:19:42 +0100 <mwseibel> I want people from underrepresented background to be able to raise money and build the tech companies that aren‚Äôt being created today.
1038461079490162688 2018-09-08 17:16:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Telling them that the system is biased against them doesn‚Äôt help them raise money and accomplish their goals.
1038460520272031746 2018-09-08 17:14:16 +0100 <mwseibel> But the most common question I get from non-tech founders is why can‚Äôt I raise money?  What am I supposed to tell them?
1038460344723681280 2018-09-08 17:13:34 +0100 <mwseibel> My challenge is that if founders want money from tech investors they need to understand what they are looking for.  I‚Äôd argue that a lot of founders can create businesses without raising a lot of money or raising from tech investors.  My advice isn‚Äôt meant for these founders.
1038459699639738368 2018-09-08 17:11:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Is the NBA biased because it mostly recruits tall people?  It‚Äôs a lot easier to learn to code or find a tech co-founder than it is to grow 6-12 inches.  I want to help people learn that tech is something they can leverage to do great things for the world.
1038458276696928256 2018-09-08 17:05:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I think anyone is capable of creating a venture backable tech startup.  For those who are interested I want to be here to help them.  I honestly have little experience with other types of companies so I‚Äôm not qualified to help people create them.
1038442372084916224 2018-09-08 16:02:09 +0100 <mwseibel> Sure! Michael@ycombinator.com
1038442239179935745 2018-09-08 16:01:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Great thread! https://twitter.com/APatelThompson/status/1038439429361156096¬†‚Ä¶
1038441695346536449 2018-09-08 15:59:28 +0100 <mwseibel> As always.  This is for tech startups and/or startups that want to raise from tech investors.
1038441694184726531 2018-09-08 15:59:27 +0100 <mwseibel> By do more work I don‚Äôt mean spend money to outsource engineering.  Talk to customers, build v1 yourself using a website creator and excel as your backend, get your first sale, etc.
1038441693077372929 2018-09-08 15:59:27 +0100 <mwseibel> 8) If you ask the people on your list and they say no or maybe.  Do more work to push your startup forward and ask again.  Remember your ask needs to be specific (equity, time commitment, etc)
1038441691114496000 2018-09-08 15:59:27 +0100 <mwseibel> (If you are working with someone you just met.  Trust that many times good investors will want to wait some months to see if you really get along)
1038441689877110784 2018-09-08 15:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> 7) One thing you should also know is that when strangers start tech startups together - in our experience at YC - they break up quickly at an alarmingly high rate.  So it‚Äôs better to do a company with people you know is some pre-existing context.
1038441688828506112 2018-09-08 15:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> (If you are still in school and might want to start a startup one day - consider that‚Äôs it probably helpful to make friends with students who are learning CS).
1038441687146590208 2018-09-08 15:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> 6) If you don‚Äôt know anyone technical.  Consider getting a job at a tech startup and building your network of software developers.
1038441685850578944 2018-09-08 15:59:25 +0100 <mwseibel> By that I mean - if the startup doesn‚Äôt work in two years.  We shut it down - no harm no foul.
1038441684642684928 2018-09-08 15:59:25 +0100 <mwseibel> 5) Make the people on your list a real offer.  Tell them exactly how much equity you‚Äôd be willing to give them (for early stage company this number should be probably be fairly high).  Also tell them that you are looking for a 2 year no progress commitment.
1038441683489239044 2018-09-08 15:59:25 +0100 <mwseibel> 4) Seek people from your friend / work network.  Make a list of everyone you know who writes code as their primary job and who you would enjoy tackling hard problems with.
1038441682113519618 2018-09-08 15:59:24 +0100 <mwseibel> 3) Consider whether you should start with an idea at all.  Perhaps it‚Äôs better to have a problem / cause you are passionate about and the brainstorm potential solutions with potential technical partners.
1038441680821661696 2018-09-08 15:59:24 +0100 <mwseibel> 2) Consider whether or not you need to work on your idea.  Perhaps you should help a tech-cofounder with their idea (that‚Äôs what I did at  http://Justin.tv¬†).
1038441675515809794 2018-09-08 15:59:23 +0100 <mwseibel> 1) It‚Äôs hard but important.  Stick with it.  Trust that this is just one of the many many hard things you‚Äôll have to do to succeed.
1038441674114879488 2018-09-08 15:59:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Advice to non-technical founders looking for a tech co-founder:
1038434791861809152 2018-09-08 15:32:02 +0100 <mwseibel> If you aren‚Äôt trying to build a tech company or raise money from tech investors please ignore this because I have little experience outside of tech and I‚Äôm not qualified to give you advice.
1038434789718511617 2018-09-08 15:32:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Now this is a very typical path I see from hundreds of conversations with founders over the past 5 years who are trying to build tech companies and/or raise money from tech investors.
1038434788388921344 2018-09-08 15:32:01 +0100 <mwseibel> As a result they often go into zombie mode and die.
1038434787151597568 2018-09-08 15:32:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Now the founder is caught.  If they had more progress/traction they can probably raise but they already spent most of their money on outsourcing so they don‚Äôt have any runway.
1038434785847214084 2018-09-08 15:32:00 +0100 <mwseibel> No the founder wants to try to raise money from tech investors but the use of outsourced dev (especially for first time founders) is such a red flag that early funding attempts are unsuccessful.
1038434784664477696 2018-09-08 15:32:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Good founders iterate quickly so suddenly more and more money needs to be spent outsourcing.
1038434783540391938 2018-09-08 15:32:00 +0100 <mwseibel> The problem is they will have a very hard time figuring out if the code they receive was high quality and they will have no way to maintain/iterate on that code without spending more money.
1038434779895554048 2018-09-08 15:31:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Even a super talented non-technical founder is going to run into a situation where they need code written.  At this point they will need to spend money to outsource...
1038434778716942336 2018-09-08 15:31:59 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve been asked to further explain why it is hard to build a tech startup (and raise money from tech investors) if you outsource software development...
1038427837470990337 2018-09-08 15:04:24 +0100 <mwseibel>  https://blog.ycombinator.com/splitting-equity-among-founders/¬†‚Ä¶
1038427587540729856 2018-09-08 15:03:24 +0100 <mwseibel> And to combat your points specifically... the last batch featured founders from over 15 countries (not 5 schools).  The average age was 29+ not 22.  And more than half the companies were working to make je world better place explicitly.  Do your homework.
1038427199781519360 2018-09-08 15:01:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Nina.  You can dismiss me if you like.  But YC has now funded more underrepresented founders than any other tech investor.  I‚Äôm trying to give these people the information and tools they need to succeed.
1038426680107225088 2018-09-08 14:59:48 +0100 <mwseibel> The unfortunately fact is that IF you need to raise money from tech investors.  Then you either need to fit some form of pattern or be much much further along.  I‚Äôm just trying to tell people the facts they need to get ahead.
1038426367325495296 2018-09-08 14:58:33 +0100 <mwseibel> I appreciate wanting to give people hope and inspiration.  But I feel like sometimes founders aren‚Äôt given real facts.  The facts they need to make it in the business.  When I started I wish more people had be straight up with me.
1037871078037643264 2018-09-07 02:12:02 +0100 <mwseibel> In that case - good luck!  Btw - there is a huge difference between not having a technical co-founder and outsourcing and having a technical co-founder and outsourcing...
1037870429916942336 2018-09-07 02:09:27 +0100 <mwseibel> Finally, don't ask a question before describing what your company does in 2 sentences... https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-email-early-stage-investors/¬†‚Ä¶
1037870428688023552 2018-09-07 02:09:27 +0100 <mwseibel> More insight from YC Startup School questions.  Don't waste your time with theoretical questions.  Be specific and ask about your startup.  Also, don't ask me about my startup experience - ask my about your problem and I'll incorporate my startup experience if its relevant.

1037749250497507329 2018-09-06 18:07:56 +0100 <mwseibel> If you are trying to build a large and impactful tech company - outsourcing tech is going to make your path 1000x harder...
1037749248576475141 2018-09-06 18:07:55 +0100 <mwseibel> What is really disappointing are the predatory businesses that tell these people it's okay not to have a tech co-founder, we will build your product for you... just pay us all your money.
1037749247796338688 2018-09-06 18:07:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Basically, they are stuck in one way or another and when they ask for advice the only real answer is "get a technical co-founder."  Needless to say they've heard this advice before.
1037749246374502402 2018-09-06 18:07:55 +0100 <mwseibel> I gave a YC Startup School talk yesterday ( https://www.startupschool.org/¬†) and have now received a ton of email questions from startup school participants (keep them coming!).  The questions that are most distressing are the ones that come from teams without a tech co-founder...

1031305759714304000 2018-08-19 23:23:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I am consistently surprised how much hard work is a differentiator among startup investors...  Honestly, it is the only consistently performing differentiator I've seen.

1026868993468948480 2018-08-07 17:33:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats!
1026286969326718976 2018-08-06 03:00:55 +0100 <mwseibel> YouTube fixed this problem with pro accounts and my usage of their product went way up (stealing time from the Facebook app).
1026286968571756545 2018-08-06 03:00:55 +0100 <mwseibel> For me it‚Äôs the ratio of organic friend content vs promotional content.  Now for every 2-3 pieces of friend content I see one ad.
1026286967791611904 2018-08-06 03:00:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Is a relatively tiny market (online dating) really worth the risk?  Why not instead figure out what is driving previously active users away from Facebook core and fix it.
1026286966243876869 2018-08-06 03:00:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Isn‚Äôt someone worried that all of this expansion going to result in government regulation.  Even more so when 2-3 big companies control most non-word of mouth methods of distribution?
1026286965396623360 2018-08-06 03:00:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Why do the big tech companies feel the need to get into literally every online business?  Especially when often times their best products are purchased instead of built internally. https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/3/17649624/facebook-dating-app-internal-testing-profiles¬†‚Ä¶
1026163742487195648 2018-08-05 18:51:16 +0100 <mwseibel> God I wish more companies ran this way!!!!

1024529183114809345 2018-08-01 06:36:06 +0100 <mwseibel> You know I think the biggest determinant is communication style.  There is a way that people in our community talk to one another if you hit that response rates go way up.  I‚Äôve written a post about it:  http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
1024387591657803776 2018-07-31 21:13:28 +0100 <mwseibel> :)
1024387260332953600 2018-07-31 21:12:09 +0100 <mwseibel> Just start sending emails - and don't make them too long...  http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
1024387058393993216 2018-07-31 21:11:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Good point.  I tried to be careful by saying economic incentive.  Lots of people were helpful to Zuck who never got paid for the help I'm sure.
1024386325682634752 2018-07-31 21:08:26 +0100 <mwseibel> "Do you know anyone who..." is not a very effective way to ask for an intro in my opinion...  much easier when you've done the research and you know who you'd like to talk to.
1024315795273207808 2018-07-31 16:28:11 +0100 <mwseibel> Also note - I'm talking about the startup industry not the tech industry.  The more I work in the startup industry the more I realize how little it actually overlaps with "big tech".
1024315794581151747 2018-07-31 16:28:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Unlike many other industries, startup founders rarely think of themselves as competing against each other and often think of themselves as collectively competing against almost certain death.
1024315793721315328 2018-07-31 16:28:10 +0100 <mwseibel> I think this has something to do with how rare success is and how humble most successful founders are.  Every successful founder knows that their victory had a lot to do with luck.
1024315792697901059 2018-07-31 16:28:10 +0100 <mwseibel> The image/prestige of the startup world has taken some big hits in the last couple years and it's not inclusive as it should be.  But by and large the startup community is one of the most helpful, most sharing, and most selfless communities you could ever belong to.
1024315791385055232 2018-07-31 16:28:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Something I see every day that is rarely discussed: founders/former founders/experienced founders helping new founders when they have no economic incentive to do so.  This is part of the culture that makes the startup world work.
1024297113453129728 2018-07-31 15:13:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Big congrats!  So happy to be supporting another YC growth stage company! https://twitter.com/anuhariharan/status/1024295887026024448¬†‚Ä¶
1023580878654464000 2018-07-29 15:47:53 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôm afraid that Google controlling so much of email means that Email is no longer an open distribution system...  This is exactly the same thing Facebook did with Pages...

1019718816496902144 2018-07-19 00:01:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes!  I think PR and Design are both ends in and of themselves.  But the beauty of design should never sacrifice usability (and this is measurable).
1019707966646202368 2018-07-18 23:18:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Btw - as much as I like to discount design vs functionality, sometimes great design just makes you feel good inside.  This effect can never be discounted.  It makes users happy and builders proud.

1018963225050615808 2018-07-16 21:58:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Also - I love all YC alumni but I think it is particularly hard for them to give advice on this subject.  If you want to do YC - just apply!

1018963221577809920 2018-07-16 21:58:58 +0100 <mwseibel> The number of founders who think that YC has a rule that eliminates them from consideration is astounding.  Founder's break rules!  If you want to do YC - just apply.  Applications can be started here:  http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/¬†
1018944450226106368 2018-07-16 20:44:22 +0100 <mwseibel> This is correct - the tech world has temporarily lost the ‚Äúwe are making the world a better place‚Äù argument and we are now suffering for it.
1018883674664681472 2018-07-16 16:42:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats!
1017476209788182528 2018-07-12 19:30:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Write software for YC and learn about our org from the inside: https://twitter.com/gustaf/status/1017149702024785920¬†‚Ä¶
1017085816965816320 2018-07-11 17:38:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly product market fit is probably far away - $300k for a software company should easily get your MVP built, some customers, and some product iterations and learnings.  Proves you can build and ship and sell and listen.
1017085432905940992 2018-07-11 17:37:18 +0100 <mwseibel> We are working on a post that uncovers the math behind why it‚Äôs valuable to do YC.  The method of raising a very small amount of money or no money, building an MVP, applying to YC, growing, and then raising an angel round on demoday is one of the most optimal paths for startups.
1017061489138491392 2018-07-11 16:02:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I think this is super smart - it honestly doesn‚Äôt take very much money to build a software mvp.
1016723969683087362 2018-07-10 17:40:58 +0100 <mwseibel> I've seen many YC founders learn how to become great leaders and managers over time.
1016720633554538497 2018-07-10 17:27:43 +0100 <mwseibel> "After you raise a seed round and before you get a fancy office and hire a dozen people, you must see your company as it really is. Do you have product market fit or not? If not, save as much money as you can, spend more time with your customers, and build a product they need."
1016720595952660480 2018-07-10 17:27:34 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm talking to founders who have just finished raising their seed round.  YC s18 founders are headed into demo day in the next month.  The message I sending is this:

1015397347855982595 2018-07-07 01:49:27 +0100 <mwseibel> @googlephotos - love the product but too many clicks to get a share link - it‚Äôs one of my top two actions in the app and on the website
1014896104314290176 2018-07-05 16:37:41 +0100 <mwseibel> @patrickc - thanks - I really enjoyed reading this essay:  https://patrickcollison.com/advice¬†
1014148554141589504 2018-07-03 15:07:11 +0100 <mwseibel> Great article!!!  Progressive reduction - I like that idea a lot.
1013914423440707584 2018-07-02 23:36:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks! - helpful article.  I still would love to see the data.  I know FB is very data driven so I think there are probably some very interesting insights in these design changes.  Perhaps something that can be useful to YC startups.
1013897404523769856 2018-07-02 22:29:13 +0100 <mwseibel> This isn't well understood...
1013896842948460544 2018-07-02 22:26:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Also the designer that looks at this UI all day long might tend to be biased in one direction.  Also many of these established apps create design trends that carry through to less established apps where people actually do need to know what the buttons do...
1013896530200182785 2018-07-02 22:25:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Shouldn't this translate into more time in app / more actions per session - I'd love to see the data.  I worry that what feel pleasing to one person feels confusing to another.
1013894297148579840 2018-07-02 22:16:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Have people really memorized the icon for Marketplace?
1013893985318854659 2018-07-02 22:15:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Why is looking clean something that matters empirically?
1013893765642182657 2018-07-02 22:14:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Really though?  Emojis don‚Äôt have menus and complicated features hidden behind the click - how many people would guess that this means marketplace? pic.twitter.com/lZPPJnuktR
1013893401664675844 2018-07-02 22:13:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Sure - but translating isn‚Äôt very hard - we did it as a startup
1013893316151164928 2018-07-02 22:12:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Isn‚Äôt this testable?
1013893215022342144 2018-07-02 22:12:34 +0100 <mwseibel> I really should have asked does anyone have any data on why no labels and unclear buttons are better?
1013863749655015424 2018-07-02 20:15:29 +0100 <mwseibel> btw - this is a zero snark tweet - I assume there are good reasons for both - I'd just love to know what they are...
1013863472344399873 2018-07-02 20:14:23 +0100 <mwseibel> There are two design conventions going around that I don't understand.  Could someone please educate me.  1) Buttons without labels (example 1: Facebook app bottom bar)  2) Buttons that don't look like buttons (example 2: Google Photos - the check mark is clickable) pic.twitter.com/sAL2hLtL2Y
1013648230138036225 2018-07-02 05:59:05 +0100 <mwseibel> Great tool for new startups - OpenPhone lets you get a business phone number with an app  https://tcrn.ch/2KmWqQA¬† via @techcrunch
1013410635793625088 2018-07-01 14:14:58 +0100 <mwseibel> More often in the tech startup world product success leads to a strong network rather than a strong network creating product success.  That is one of the strengths of Silicon Valley.  Allocate your founder time and resources accordingly.
1013409543080927234 2018-07-01 14:10:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Something I learned from PG: Its impossible to disrupt an existing industry if you spend ALL your time trying to been seen as cool by its current leaders, investors, and influencers.  The users are where you need to focus.
1013262929322340352 2018-07-01 04:28:02 +0100 <mwseibel> An amazing (and scary) comment from Reddit on opiod use: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/8v41wj/comment/e1kumxs?st=JJ29YA1R&sh=2a6ad148¬†‚Ä¶
1013154998950100992 2018-06-30 21:19:09 +0100 <mwseibel> Grow the Puzzle Around You  http://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/grow-the-puzzle-around-you¬†‚Ä¶. Great talk by @jesslivingston at the YC Female Founders Conference today.
1012906769272590336 2018-06-30 04:52:47 +0100 <mwseibel> All YC companies should understand this! https://twitter.com/suhail/status/1012860530791346177¬†‚Ä¶
1012739561850470401 2018-06-29 17:48:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes - but you have to be able to prove you can execute quickly - to be honest applications aren't due until Oct.  If you have an idea now - you should have more than an idea in Oct.
1012581799371796480 2018-06-29 07:21:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Never did
1012580415230472192 2018-06-29 07:15:58 +0100 <mwseibel> The beginning is here though... which is truly impressive @jack
1012580414060261376 2018-06-29 07:15:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Tweet storming built into the Twitter app helps a lot but the UI around consuming multi-person conversations and the fragmentation of conversations makes it hard to have a real discussion.
1012580412919459840 2018-06-29 07:15:57 +0100 <mwseibel> But it might need more than 280 characters and moderation features would be extremely important.
1012580410142801920 2018-06-29 07:15:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Clearly it wasn‚Äôt perfect... (there was a lot of war in Ender‚Äôs Game) but imagine the ability to have real, in-depth, and interesting public conversations.  A place like that might inspire the next generation of leaders...
1012580408603471872 2018-06-29 07:15:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Sometimes I wonder how Twitter would be different if you were required to write 3 paragraphs instead of a couple sentences.  Remember the ‚ÄúNets‚Äù in Ender‚Äôs Game?  Major public policy discussions were occurring ‚Äúin public‚Äù with open participation.
1012577697401221120 2018-06-29 07:05:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Actually I literally said you can‚Äôt A/B test in the tweet right after.  I was suggesting the idea as a thought experiment.  My apologies that I offended you.
1012577319888678913 2018-06-29 07:03:40 +0100 <mwseibel> Wow - sorry to offend you
1012510438926385152 2018-06-29 02:37:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Interestingly I think the opposite would also be very popular...
1012507586879344640 2018-06-29 02:26:34 +0100 <mwseibel> I know - I just couldn‚Äôt put two and two together looking at that picture :)
1012505745554751491 2018-06-29 02:19:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Ahh - now I remember - love it!
1012505648695668737 2018-06-29 02:18:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Where is this?
1012504370120802304 2018-06-29 02:13:47 +0100 <mwseibel> I agree!  It turns out that a democracy might run on norms and traditions more than laws.  Destroy the norms and everything is up for grabs.
1012503955702550528 2018-06-29 02:12:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I should have been more clear - I think the states are quiet different and many experiments are being running now.  The problem is that the people who hold political beliefs often don‚Äôt get to expeirent the results of these experiments. So it‚Äôs hard for their positions to evolve.
1012503150383644673 2018-06-29 02:08:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Totally makes sense but there has to be degrees of tribalism no?
1012503015922720768 2018-06-29 02:08:25 +0100 <mwseibel> That is a good point - I think maybe institutional/political debt is the biggest risk in our American democracy.  I haven‚Äôt seen many ways to pay it down without economic bubbles or wars...
1012502647679545344 2018-06-29 02:06:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Just using the common language of most people not trying to make the point that they aren‚Äôt connected.  Trying to make the point that most people disagree with some fundamental positions of their own political team.
1012501942327640065 2018-06-29 02:04:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I just feel like these debates can turn into language gotyas which takes away from the point.  I keep I thinking it wish there was a way (with no suffering) to just give people what they way they want.  And then let them see if they actually like it.
1012501507038576640 2018-06-29 02:02:25 +0100 <mwseibel> You know I agree in theory but these debates still rip us apart as a nation.  I wish there was a way to simulate giving people exactly what they say they want so they can see if they actually like it.  Best way to know whether you like broccoli is to taste it, not argue about it.
1012500721051160576 2018-06-29 01:59:17 +0100 <mwseibel> The point that I was trying to make is that many people don‚Äôt agree with many of the positions of the political parties they belong to.  It is common to hear people say I‚Äôm socially this but fiscally that.  I was use an approachable example.  I agree with your point though.
1012390029543391232 2018-06-28 18:39:26 +0100 <mwseibel> We‚Äôve got some in every batch
1012389564340580352 2018-06-28 18:37:36 +0100 <mwseibel> I assume you‚Äôll have something to show by then
1012389505750319105 2018-06-28 18:37:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Applications are due in Oct
1012389388452413440 2018-06-28 18:36:54 +0100 <mwseibel> I guess I should have said A/B/C/D test <grin>
1012363605616939009 2018-06-28 16:54:27 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs my core belief though that our system was built for stability over speed and this American tradition of political fighting is what keeps us free (but not always happy).
1012363604354465793 2018-06-28 16:54:26 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs hard to accept that the fight between the right and left overtime is what creates long term strength and stability in our country.  Especially when consider the speed of progress in countries like China.
1012363603339403265 2018-06-28 16:54:26 +0100 <mwseibel> I really wished there was a way to separate economic policy and social policy in our country.  I know a lot people on both sides who simply cannot defend their party‚Äôs position on one of these fronts.
1012363601536012289 2018-06-28 16:54:26 +0100 <mwseibel> But we can‚Äôt - so in times like these I remember this MLK quote: ‚ÄúThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.‚Äù
1012363600386711557 2018-06-28 16:54:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Instead of this back and forth between liberals and conservatives sometimes I wish we could run the most extreme A/B test for a year (or a decade) and then just ask people which country they liked better....
1012225313579851776 2018-06-28 07:44:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Closer to deadline
1012225247741804545 2018-06-28 07:44:39 +0100 <mwseibel> This isn‚Äôt true
1012225177646579712 2018-06-28 07:44:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Nope
1012225107853340673 2018-06-28 07:44:06 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs been very interesting seeing @harris and the team collect data and insights on the Series A process.  It‚Äôs still very much shrouded in mystery with lots of conflicting advice.
1012165354687102976 2018-06-28 03:46:40 +0100 <mwseibel> Actually the YC deal is 7% for 120k - just want to make sure everyone knows the facts.
1012165082283819009 2018-06-28 03:45:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Just witnessed the first dinner of the first YC Series A batch.  The goal is to help YC companies better organize and execute their Series A fundraising process.  @harris is leading this up and doing a great job and the companies are great as well.

1012006902723538944 2018-06-27 17:17:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Sounds like they need a YC one liner
1011824551741702144 2018-06-27 05:12:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Boom! Great job @BenJealous https://twitter.com/chudson/status/1011818384030248960¬†‚Ä¶
1011333211018821632 2018-06-25 20:40:01 +0100 <mwseibel> @DialpadHQ @uberconference every 1-4 weeks I‚Äôm logged out of the app and have to reauth.  I only see this when I‚Äôm calling in for a conference call.  Anything you guys can do?
1011253103817965568 2018-06-25 15:21:42 +0100 <mwseibel> I love this!
1011252994522746880 2018-06-25 15:21:16 +0100 <mwseibel> How many Yale students were lead to the 2008 slaughter with that vocational decision.  Yale always talks about being a non-vocational school when in fact it‚Äôs just pushing the wrong vocations.
1011252622957821953 2018-06-25 15:19:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I should have been clear that I was referring to the US tech scene in my post
1011244005122805761 2018-06-25 14:45:33 +0100 <mwseibel> Only 1 connection really mattered for my career.  And to get it I had to drop out for a year.  That sounds like mostly luck.
1011238199803297793 2018-06-25 14:22:29 +0100 <mwseibel> When I was going to school in the early 2000s I wish Yale made a better case to all freshman on how valuable learning to program is.  I‚Äôd argue it was 10x more valuable than all the econ classes we were shoved into.  Learning that skill alone would have made the $150k worth it.
1011238198532378624 2018-06-25 14:22:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Also high school and college kids need to remember that startups are like most jobs in the modern economy, a STEM education opens the most doors.
1011238197253189632 2018-06-25 14:22:28 +0100 <mwseibel> ... if it doesn‚Äôt work out, often you can still get that big company job with a higher salary and more responsibility than if you had just worked there from the beginning.
1011238195940417537 2018-06-25 14:22:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Interestingly - even despite the risks - I think it is becoming smarter and smarter to start a company if you have technical skills.  There is funding available...
1011238194556178432 2018-06-25 14:22:28 +0100 <mwseibel> Many college grads are told that getting a job at the big companies of today will set them up for life.  I‚Äôm pretty sure this is less true today than it was for our parent‚Äôs generation.  And it wasn‚Äôt very true for them either.
1011238193306353665 2018-06-25 14:22:27 +0100 <mwseibel> Something very similar happened to my Dad at Merrill Lynch / Bank of America

1007623969736835072 2018-06-15 15:00:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Hello :) - I‚Äôd love a demo - my email is michael@ycombinator.com
1007347586347327489 2018-06-14 20:42:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks!
1007347489291161600 2018-06-14 20:42:11 +0100 <mwseibel> One of the most fun parts of YC is learning from founders.  I‚Äôve learned so much about so many problems/industries that I never would have been exposed to otherwise.
1007346769083052033 2018-06-14 20:39:20 +0100 <mwseibel> I hate when early founders believe that investors are the smartest people in the room.  Having money/leverage does not make you smarter.  I‚Äôd rather learn from a room full of founders than a room full of investors any day!
1007346403855593473 2018-06-14 20:37:52 +0100 <mwseibel> ‚ÄúBut, it seems, the talent market is looking to the investment community to signal to them what companies are worth working for. It should work the other way around...  Capital should follow talent, not talent following capital.‚Äù - @fred
1007345310585139200 2018-06-14 20:33:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Really interesting thread https://twitter.com/sarahtaber_bww/status/1006363772838170629¬†‚Ä¶

1003717085308989440 2018-06-04 20:16:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Introducing YC Series A Batches https://blog.ycombinator.com/introducing-yc-series-a-batches/¬†‚Ä¶
1003712415287017472 2018-06-04 19:57:42 +0100 <mwseibel> YC looks to help more of its companies lock down Series A funding  https://tcrn.ch/2HiSo5p¬† via @techcrunch

1002664379207151616 2018-06-01 22:33:11 +0100 <mwseibel> This was totally your suggestion 3-4 years ago :) - we are finally getting our act together - thanks for the push!

1002558228876570625 2018-06-01 15:31:23 +0100 <mwseibel> This happens often - but founder have to always remember who is running the company.
1002350404091301888 2018-06-01 01:45:33 +0100 <mwseibel> When you write it all down like that is sounds way more impressive than I remember it - remember there was a great deal of luck and not dying involved :)
1002299928624820224 2018-05-31 22:24:59 +0100 <mwseibel> In my book patient doesn‚Äôt mean a lack of activity - it means high activity, low burn, and understanding that building something people want can take time.
1002296819035000832 2018-05-31 22:12:38 +0100 <mwseibel> I don‚Äôt think investors help companies by telling them to ramp burn pre-product market fit.  I often think there would be more successful startups if the startup community (founders and investors) was willing to be more patient.
1002296457410457600 2018-05-31 22:11:11 +0100 <mwseibel> What disappoints me more than anything are the companies that think burn = progress and then flame out in 1.5-2 years.
1002296239164088320 2018-05-31 22:10:19 +0100 <mwseibel> I started part time at YC over 5 years ago and have now seen about 1000 YC companies. The thing that never ceases to amaze me is the success that comes from the companies that figure out how to stay lean and stay alive over the course of years.
1002193642214211585 2018-05-31 15:22:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Nice work!

996815493905305600 2018-05-16 19:11:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Disruption doesn‚Äôt require reinventing every wheel - it requires reinventing only the smallest number of wheels possible to create something that users love.
996815285930807296 2018-05-16 19:10:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Re: the language of startup culture vs conformity of the valley... this isn‚Äôt really a debate I care for.  Every industry will be distrusted by tech.  This has always been the case in our history and always will be the case....
996814751228313600 2018-05-16 19:08:51 +0100 <mwseibel> It often takes 10 years+ to make a startup that has significant impact.  If I named newer startups that are 3D printing rockets, trying to cure cancer, measuring opioid usage in cities, or creating alternatives to incarceration these are names that most people wouldn‚Äôt know yet.
996809167775002624 2018-05-16 18:46:40 +0100 <mwseibel> ... Airbnb was thought of as a joke (people letting stranger into their homes), Coinbase was fools errand, and Cruise was founder with little background and not even a bachelors degree (MIT dropout) trying to build self driving cars.
996808724453863424 2018-05-16 18:44:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Also if you look at some of our successful investments you would certainly find founders who were cutting against the grain: Twitch started as an online reality TV show, Dropbox was ‚Äúdoomed from the beginning‚Äù because of predicted competition from Google...
996808197607378945 2018-05-16 18:42:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Our goal at YC is to give people access to the startup world (ie: investment, advice, peers, support, etc).  For many, including myself, without YC that access was completely not available.  Almost every other on ramp required a warm intro that wasn‚Äôt available to me.
993876934613348352 2018-05-08 16:35:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol - I thought you loved ICOs!
993517298680905734 2018-05-07 16:45:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Great post for anyone thinking about fundraising - especially good for the YC founders looking to raise series A in the next 12 months - Process and Leverage in Fundraising   https://blog.ycombinator.com/process-and-leverage-in-fundraising/¬†‚Ä¶ #

993338488547299329 2018-05-07 04:55:25 +0100 <mwseibel> PS: re Google - YouTube is also still going strong.  My daily usage has trended up over the past 5 years.  Impressive!
993338027945574400 2018-05-07 04:53:35 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôve always been a huge Facebook fan since joining back in 2005.  I hope this is just a sign of me getting older.  (Btw - my wife says everyone is on Instagram now.  I‚Äôm just not into sharing photos.)
993338026557259777 2018-05-07 04:53:35 +0100 <mwseibel> Interestingly - Google is still a central player in my life.  Even as an iPhone user Google Search, Docs, Gmail, and Maps are critical every single day.
993338025072476160 2018-05-07 04:53:35 +0100 <mwseibel> On the plus side Oculus Go is pretty neat...  and Whatapp is essential to my work and social life.  Still - where did all my Facebook friends go?
993338023877033984 2018-05-07 04:53:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Slowly but surely my Facebook newsfeed is declining.  A mix of ads, ‚Äúviral content‚Äù, and people I don‚Äôt know well have taken over my feed.  Facebook is no longer the first app I check when opening my phone.
992937360693186560 2018-05-06 02:21:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Congrats!

989757700706746368 2018-04-27 07:46:39 +0100 <mwseibel> I‚Äôd get the strangest ads...  what would they sell me to solve the stress of applications, interviews, demo day, office hours, and YC tour... hell I might be interested in buying.
989623191113875456 2018-04-26 22:52:09 +0100 <mwseibel> They did a great job! https://twitter.com/brezina/status/989612814946844674¬†‚Ä¶
989530470491701250 2018-04-26 16:43:43 +0100 <mwseibel> That way as people compose their email they will be able to read that status and create an internal expectation about when they can expect a response. Gmail is the only place I would keep my status up to date because it's my primary work application. What do you think?
989530468856029184 2018-04-26 16:43:43 +0100 <mwseibel> What I'd like to do is set my current status in Gmail.  When trying to email me - perhaps when selecting my name to the "to:" field, the status could be displayed in a bar on top of the compose window...
989530467928965120 2018-04-26 16:43:42 +0100 <mwseibel> I want to let people know that I'm slammed but definitely will reply to their email but I don't want to use an auto-reply email because I think they are rude and I hate getting them when I email someone...
989530466700087301 2018-04-26 16:43:42 +0100 <mwseibel> I have a small problem that I think @gmail could fix.  Often times there is something going on at YC that causes me to be slow to respond to email.  This week it was YC interviews.  A couple weeks before it was YC application reading....
989355342872985600 2018-04-26 05:07:49 +0100 <mwseibel> Why does this happen in our ‚Äúfree‚Äù country? https://twitter.com/kelseybew_/status/989132611854524417¬†‚Ä¶
987456833961971712 2018-04-20 23:23:49 +0100 <mwseibel> My group (Group 5) had two amazing black female founders - Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins from Promise and Lisa Gelobter from tEQuitable.  I don't find it surprising that both of their startups have a strong social impact mission.
987456437449207808 2018-04-20 23:22:15 +0100 <mwseibel> I 100% agree we have a lot more work to do to attract underrepresented founders to the program.  In total we had 54 Female Founders and 31 Black/Latinx founders in the W2018 batch.
987429741253738496 2018-04-20 21:36:10 +0100 <mwseibel> And shout out to Group 5: one of the most interesting and compelling groups @gustaf and I have ever had the opportunity to lead. pic.twitter.com/D4TDhPNZHO

985536436848836608 2018-04-15 16:12:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Note to founders - check the copyright year on your website.  It's a subtle that shows you are paying attention to details.

984571061160165376 2018-04-13 00:16:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I've been a huge Facebook user for over 10 years and I still love it but for the first time today I saw so many ads that I thought there was a bug.

982546588064272384 2018-04-07 10:12:16 +0100 <mwseibel> I see too many team that die because they took what little money they had - outsourced development - got a crappy MVP back that breaks all the time - and have no more money to fix it or iterate.   What would you tell them?
982545609457618945 2018-04-07 10:08:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Im seeing this from companies who aren‚Äôt in the Bay Area and who have raised seed money.  That‚Äôs what is so surprising.
982545258922856449 2018-04-07 10:06:59 +0100 <mwseibel> We are on the same side here but I just want to be clear - I desperately want more underrepresented founders.
982544642930630656 2018-04-07 10:04:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Imagine if you wanted to go to college but you didn‚Äôt know you needed to take the SATs to get into a great school.  You would be at a huge information disadvantage.  I‚Äôm trying to get rid of that information disadvantage to give everyone the knowledge they need to complete.
982544221684027392 2018-04-07 10:02:51 +0100 <mwseibel> We have funded over 300 underrepresented founders in the last 2.5 years.  This wasn‚Äôt a barrier for them.  I think one of the biggest barriers to underrepresented founders is a lack of information about the startup world.
982301069777649664 2018-04-06 17:56:39 +0100 <mwseibel> Of course there are exceptions to every "rule".  But what worries me is that access to these "rules" is not spread equally.  If everyone actually knew the "rules" and the logic/painful stories behind them, I'd be far more comfortable with founders trying to break them.
982300487767678977 2018-04-06 17:54:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Muggsy Bogues was a 5 foot 2 inch NBA player.  Would you go around telling 5-2 folks that they have a good shot at making it into the NBA?  What if there was something they could actually do to grow 1.5 feet?  Would you tell them not to do that cause it worked out for Muggsy?
982289269094998018 2018-04-06 17:09:46 +0100 <mwseibel> I've hear this from a lot central / south american and eastern european founders.
982280026359042054 2018-04-06 16:33:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Do you disagree when advising founders of software startups or CPG/consumer hardware startups?  Do you think the advice to these two different types of startups re:technical co-founders should be different?
982274905583554562 2018-04-06 16:12:41 +0100 <mwseibel> So true!
982270731869286405 2018-04-06 15:56:06 +0100 <mwseibel> We've had a number of tech founders from Africa participate in YC.  @paystack for example has two technical co-founders.  Finding co-founders is always hard - way harder than hiring engineers.  Usually it required being friends first - before pitching someone on the idea.
982270101503164416 2018-04-06 15:53:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Especially for companies whose primary product is software!
982269960645885953 2018-04-06 15:53:02 +0100 <mwseibel> There are no automatic no's when reading YC applications.  It's just that I think a lot of founders would make their limited resources stretch much further with a proper technical co-founder.  I think outsourcing engineering to save money is almost always a bad idea.
982269382016483328 2018-04-06 15:50:45 +0100 <mwseibel> I don't understand the Fortnite example - can you explain? According to Wikipedia - both People Can Fly and Epic Games have technical co-founders.
982267399284994048 2018-04-06 15:42:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Its 2018 - why are we still having a debate about the need for technical co-founders?  Especially for tech heavy software startups?
982266625096208392 2018-04-06 15:39:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Reading YC apps I'm seeing too many founders who have raised some seed capital and who outsource engineering to cut costs.  This is a common error that is a huge red flag for future investors and is often much more expensive in the long term then having a technical co-founder.
981444759196721152 2018-04-04 09:13:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you for this tweet - it‚Äôs so much easier to help the startup founders who are trying to make the world a better place when the press gives them a chance to make their case.  There are more of these founders than people think.
979727823752409090 2018-03-30 15:31:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Would be happy to chat - my email is michael@ycombinator.com
979506199698616320 2018-03-30 00:50:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Nicely done!  I love using the Lugg app and excited for v2 :) https://twitter.com/jordanbrown/status/979365726308962304¬†‚Ä¶
979152910134030336 2018-03-29 01:27:00 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs pretty amazing - at YC we‚Äôre we just talking about the generational implications here.  I‚Äôm sure this is going to be the first of many such stories over the next 20+ years. @codeacademy is having a massive impact.  Nice work!
979101279761850368 2018-03-28 22:01:50 +0100 <mwseibel> #YCW2018 If you do as much as I do in your browser (specifically in Google Suite) you could consider using @StationHQ - its an internet browser for work and its amazing!  I‚Äôve been using it everyday for the past 2 weeks.   https://getstation.com/¬†
977434440497430528 2018-03-24 06:38:25 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly this is something we would be happy to consider.
977434307269545984 2018-03-24 06:37:53 +0100 <mwseibel> My point wasn‚Äôt that there aren‚Äôt amazing people trying to make government a better place.  It‚Äôs that government is doing a poor job of attracting them.  Apologies if I wasn‚Äôt clear.
977390663485411329 2018-03-24 03:44:27 +0100 <mwseibel> that is great to hear
977390555100413953 2018-03-24 03:44:02 +0100 <mwseibel> sure
977379666599165953 2018-03-24 03:00:46 +0100 <mwseibel> You're telling me...  I'm reading applications right now....
977374093581275136 2018-03-24 02:38:37 +0100 <mwseibel> By the numbers most of them will fail - but all of them should be celebrated.  They aren't just talking about how bad things are today.  They are trying to do something about it and YC has their back.
977374092083920896 2018-03-24 02:38:36 +0100 <mwseibel> ...but I think more people should spend some time learning about the next generation of founders who have realized how powerful software is and are now trying to use that power to make the world a better place.
977374091014430725 2018-03-24 02:38:36 +0100 <mwseibel> It will take a decade or longer for the true effect of these types of investments to be felt but I think more people should know about the brave founders who are out there trying right now.  It's so easy to beat up on the current successful tech founders making news today...
977374089861124096 2018-03-24 02:38:36 +0100 <mwseibel> ...help people save for retirement, speed up drug discovery, support refugees trying to build a new life, and more.  Companies solving these problems not only got into YC - they are out fundraising right now and for the most part the valley is investing.
977374088371912704 2018-03-24 02:38:36 +0100 <mwseibel> ... eliminate smoking, fight the opioid crisis, provide higher speed internet to those in need, increase access to mental health services, eliminate workplace harassment, eliminate sexual assault, increase the efficiency of the healthcare system...
977374087176601600 2018-03-24 02:38:35 +0100 <mwseibel> In just the past batch at YC I've seen companies/non-profits who want to reform the prison system, make it easier to learn to code, provide career services to young people, cure cancer, improve urban housing...
977374085842796545 2018-03-24 02:38:35 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm starting to believe more and more that it's possible for YC (and the valley in general) to have a disproportionate impact in solving these major problems plaguing society.
977374084647370753 2018-03-24 02:38:35 +0100 <mwseibel> However, our government isn't well functioning and even more importantly the best and brightest people I knew growing up are not attracted to public service.  The system feels inefficient, rigged, corrupted by money, and lacking the correct incentives.
977374083582054400 2018-03-24 02:38:34 +0100 <mwseibel> I had a great conversation with an old college friend that got me thinking.  Almost all of the items on YCs Request for Startups page ( https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/¬†) are problems that one would expect a well functioning government to be working to solve.

976834673665105920 2018-03-22 14:55:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I beg to differ.  Tesla resisted the temptation to build a complete vehicle from scratch at first.  The original Tesla roadster is a perfect example of Tesla following this path.  It was built with another companies frame.
976834156792557568 2018-03-22 14:53:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Probably not the best

976230494445555712 2018-03-20 22:54:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Great demo day presentation today from @TipeIO!
976217795200339968 2018-03-20 22:03:54 +0100 <mwseibel> I just watched @justinkan give his 4th YC Demo Day presentation with @atriumllp. From the 1st batch to the 26th batch glad to have you back brother.
976140628386971648 2018-03-20 16:57:16 +0100 <mwseibel> While providing a possible path - my primary goal was to destroy some commonly held myths about "the right way" to start a startup. Even more specifically the idea that you need a "great idea" at the beginning. Happy to hear your thoughts and questions on the subject.
976140627543928832 2018-03-20 16:57:16 +0100 <mwseibel> One thing I'll point out from the onset is that there are many paths to starting a startup and this one is not the only one (and probably not even be the best).
976140626516353024 2018-03-20 16:57:15 +0100 <mwseibel> I've been invited to some universities lately to talk to students about Y Combinator and the question "how do I come up with a good startup idea?" comes up every time. In this essay, I've attempted to write a guide for people with the same question.

972306627696115712 2018-03-10 03:02:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Applying to YC is free.  It doesn't need to be a big decision in your companies life.  If you are at all curious about YC apply.  What's the worst that could happen?
972305137237544961 2018-03-10 02:56:23 +0100 <mwseibel> I know!
972303457574010884 2018-03-10 02:49:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Also - would YC fund a company like X? Answer: yes! we love to fund all kinds of different companies.
972302949916422146 2018-03-10 02:47:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Everyday I find myself answering the same two questions: 1) Am I too early to apply to YC?  2) Am I too late to apply to YC?  - The answers? 1) no 2) no.

972129152965865472 2018-03-09 15:17:06 +0100 <mwseibel> I acknowledge this point though - YC should work harder to publicly support crypto and encourage more people to experiment in this area.
972128497069047809 2018-03-09 15:14:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Personally, I feel like @coinbase normalized crypto at YC a while back (for me it was 3-4 years ago) and that might also explain the lack of a RFS in the past.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt want/accept crypto applicants.  The opposite is the true.

971645439937150976 2018-03-08 07:14:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Crypto is certainly a widely understood and important shift in tech that we widely support and invest in. RFSs tend to single out less well known trends.
971644747155517440 2018-03-08 07:12:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Fred I‚Äôm not sure I understand your critique.  We were angel investors in @coinbase and have funded a number of crypto companies since.  I‚Äôd love to here why you think we don‚Äôt support this trend.

967078132401475585 2018-02-23 16:46:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Just visited @goldbely in NYC from YC w13 - my first batch working with YC companies.  So impressed with their progress!
966802292363051008 2018-02-22 22:30:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Whats the best way to make it to the NBA if you don't like going to the gym?  :)
966801958882308096 2018-02-22 22:28:43 +0100 <mwseibel> I think underrepresented founders see a wide set of problems in their lives that are not visible to others.  Instead of saying something specific - I encourage people just to think about the problems they face, their family face, their friends face, etc...
966801250686652416 2018-02-22 22:25:55 +0100 <mwseibel> depends what the app does and whether you are charging - also VCs are not your first stop for fundraising, angels, angel firms, and accelerators/incubators are much better

966800581535834112 2018-02-22 22:23:15 +0100 <mwseibel> these are classic:  http://paulgraham.com/articles.html¬† and  https://a16z.com/2015/01/09/pmarca-blog-ebook/¬†‚Ä¶
966800152907300864 2018-02-22 22:21:33 +0100 <mwseibel> In my experience at YC - the vast majority of founders of any race have more than an idea when they get into the program.  Now they might not be launched, they might not have traction either, but they have more than an idea for sure.
966799758164545536 2018-02-22 22:19:59 +0100 <mwseibel> Progress...  Have you launched? Do you have users? - and who writes code?
966798984055418880 2018-02-22 22:16:54 +0100 <mwseibel> I wouldn't take money from friends and family who can't afford to see their investment return 0 dollars.
966798756124418048 2018-02-22 22:16:00 +0100 <mwseibel> read this (most outreach is not effective because it is unclear or uses jargon): http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-pitch-your-company¬†‚Ä¶
966798304964050945 2018-02-22 22:14:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Competition almost never kills startups. I wouldn't be concerned about this. Most good founding teams build their (software) product MVP without help from outsiders. If they have money issues they often bootstrap. But if you are paying someone to build your MVP that rarely works.
966797578758074369 2018-02-22 22:11:19 +0100 <mwseibel> I believe there should be a disproportionate focus on people who either can code or are interested in learning how to code.  They are the fuel and they can recruit their non-technical friends.
966797226709155841 2018-02-22 22:09:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Unfortunately in tech there are many many ideas.  The way you distinguish yourself is in your ability to execute your ideas.  If you don't have a tech background - make friends with people who do.
966795784824881152 2018-02-22 22:04:11 +0100 <mwseibel> this is a good guide:  http://www.aaronkharris.com/investor-updates¬†‚Ä¶
966793793620951040 2018-02-22 21:56:17 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly this isn't something I care about in the vast majority of cases.  Customers > Advisors.
966793092513673216 2018-02-22 21:53:30 +0100 <mwseibel> The number one way YC companies die is scaling up their team too quickly.  For most startups - the team is the number 1 expense every month.  A team of 10 people working on a product with little traction/revenue runs out of time much much faster than a team of 4.
966792576853450753 2018-02-22 21:51:27 +0100 <mwseibel> I don't think a law firm is essential when starting a company at all.  Clerky and Stripe Atlas are where people should be going first.
966791716127744000 2018-02-22 21:48:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Once again - go with Clerky or Stripe Atlas and they will set you down the correct path here.  This stuff is very cookie cutter and doesn't require any innovation.
966791276862496768 2018-02-22 21:46:17 +0100 <mwseibel> #AfroTechAMA - I'm not sure I would get into venture early in your career - I think its a lot easier to start a startup first.  I think @kerby has a lot more knowledge about this career path.
966790374340542464 2018-02-22 21:42:41 +0100 <mwseibel> What do you need lawyers to do?  Much of the legal work an early stage startup needs can be done with either  https://www.clerky.com/¬† or  https://stripe.com/atlas¬†

966009496018432000 2018-02-20 17:59:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Startup advice gems by @garrytan :)
966008613360648192 2018-02-20 17:56:15 +0100 <mwseibel> In the tech startup world (I cannot speak to other worlds) when reaching out to an advisor / investor - just be straight up and ask them for what you would like.  You'd be surprised how often they try to be helpful when you are clear, straightforward, and concise.
966008274494545920 2018-02-20 17:54:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Asking for a meeting upfront is inefficient when often what you actually need is specific advice, information, or an introduction.
966007968578732032 2018-02-20 17:53:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Asking someone you've never met to be a mentor is also a recipe for a polite "no thank you" or for an email ignored.
966007739288756224 2018-02-20 17:52:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Getting product feedback on your idea from an investor/advisor who is not a potential user of your product is probably a waste of time.  Also many times this request looks like the founder is seeking the investor's validation - which doesn't put your best foot forward.
966007028190621696 2018-02-20 17:49:57 +0100 <mwseibel> When founders reach out they tend to ask for general feedback, for a mentor, or for a meeting. I think they are given this advice from others and I think its actually bad advice for tech startups. Its much better to just ask for what you'd like help with: http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
965695289863491585 2018-02-19 21:11:13 +0100 <mwseibel> Welcome Eric, Holly, Diego, Matt, Nic, Kyle, Adele, Jose, Matt, Ramon, and Gia https://blog.ycombinator.com/welcome-eric-holly-diego-matt-nic-kyle-adele-jose-matt-ramon-and-gia/¬†‚Ä¶
965351679041314816 2018-02-18 22:25:50 +0100 <mwseibel> I was referring to the federal government - not the Washington DC city government.
965349855139803136 2018-02-18 22:18:35 +0100 <mwseibel> These debates are so frustrating. The left arguing with the left and nothing getting done. I love being a liberal but SF is a strange place. You would think it would be a progressive wonderland, but it seems like the same political dynamic that haunts Washington haunt us as well.

963606343981543425 2018-02-14 02:50:30 +0100 <mwseibel> congrats!
963600732992647168 2018-02-14 02:28:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Founders are always surprised that I answer their emails and that my email address is in my twitter profile.  Helping each other is a core value in the tech startup world.  Everyone should practice it.  The startup community is a family - we should look out for one another.
963598527094972416 2018-02-14 02:19:26 +0100 <mwseibel> you know I don't but I prolly should - there is a YC company in this batch that is going to make this easier for me :)

962598788631179264 2018-02-11 08:06:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Very few business in my experience are like yours and require significant biz dev deals to get started.

962494046584299520 2018-02-11 01:10:37 +0100 <mwseibel> I don‚Äôt think many YC founders have a clear idea of exactly why they got in.
962493876593291264 2018-02-11 01:09:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Talking to users is always great! The error I see a lot is founders using networking not to talk to users but to talk to investors, partners, etc.
962492771796795392 2018-02-11 01:05:33 +0100 <mwseibel> The vast majority of companies who get into YC have never been intro‚Äôd to a YC partner before applying.  Many founders think that they need alumni recommendations - it‚Äôs simply not true.
962455755600220160 2018-02-10 22:38:28 +0100 <mwseibel> It‚Äôs not that networking/biz dev is never important - I just think it‚Äôs an easier skill to learn and making something people want is the best way to a big biz dev/networking multiplier.
962455008984711168 2018-02-10 22:35:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Err - twitter typo -  http://apply.ycombinator.com¬†
962454832228458496 2018-02-10 22:34:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I don‚Äôt believe networking / biz deving is the most important skill for most founders to hone.  I‚Äôd take technical talent and deep knowledge/connection to your customer over biz dev in many many cases.
962454226134683649 2018-02-10 22:32:23 +0100 <mwseibel> The number one thing I like about YC is that founders don‚Äôt have to network/biz dev their way into the program.  We have an open application: apply.ycombinator.con.  I feel like I have to constantly remind founders of this.

954202406954217472 2018-01-19 04:02:36 +0100 <mwseibel> Unfortunately most of my friends are startup founders :( - but I take your point.
954109431930736640 2018-01-18 21:53:09 +0100 <mwseibel> I'd like to better understand the experience of underrepresented technical people at large tech companies in the bay area (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc).  Any suggestions on who I should be reaching out to?
953689751097192448 2018-01-17 18:05:30 +0100 <mwseibel> For founders in Seattle - we would love to meet you! https://twitter.com/ycombinator/status/953688613501489152¬†‚Ä¶

953670507269840898 2018-01-17 16:49:01 +0100 <mwseibel> @lesliehook Just read your essay on YC and the valley - if you have a second let‚Äôs chat.  My one comment is that when you look at a forest sometimes it‚Äôs hard to see how unique and special each individual tree is.  I‚Äôd love to talk to you about our founders.
953301033186246656 2018-01-16 16:20:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Great project by @cadran_c https://twitter.com/ycombinator/status/953294274409451521¬†‚Ä¶
951851317013524480 2018-01-12 16:20:13 +0100 <mwseibel> According to our internal numbers approx 120 YC are over 50 employees and over 70 are over $100m valuation.
951850376948416517 2018-01-12 16:16:29 +0100 <mwseibel> So we have only 700 companies that are 3 years and older.
951849515249631232 2018-01-12 16:13:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Your math assumes that a company should be at 50 employees the second after they leave YC.  Let‚Äôs assume it can take 3 years to get to 50 employees.  In the past 3 years we‚Äôve funded about 700 companies (not including current batch).
951585983937445890 2018-01-11 22:45:52 +0100 <mwseibel> Here are the stats we‚Äôve released most recently:  https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-summer-2017-stats/¬†‚Ä¶
951560605374148608 2018-01-11 21:05:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Eileen - I don‚Äôt think you are making a fair comparison - it‚Äôs takes time to build a successful company.  We‚Äôve funded around 500 companies in the past 2 or so years.  Hard to blame them for not being 50+ people yet...

946226986698948608 2017-12-28 03:51:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Honestly I don‚Äôt know where the disagreement is here.
946226772181336065 2017-12-28 03:50:17 +0100 <mwseibel>  pic.twitter.com/7hJmZzixUd
946226432828522497 2017-12-28 03:48:56 +0100 <mwseibel> YC fully supports founders who want to create software companies and who don‚Äôt aspire to hyper growth.  Want we want them to know though is they cannot expect large amounts of money from the VC community to create these companies.
946226101574971392 2017-12-28 03:47:37 +0100 <mwseibel> In that essay, in the notes, PG draws a distinction between a software company and a software startup.  I think this debate is merely reduced to poor definitions.
946168263091699712 2017-12-27 23:57:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Happy to hear their thoughts
946093672759562243 2017-12-27 19:01:23 +0100 <mwseibel> That is our goal with this:  https://www.startupschool.org/¬†
946085078513397761 2017-12-27 18:27:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Retention of customer yes
946084947940347905 2017-12-27 18:26:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Sounds like you need more users
946067083304898560 2017-12-27 17:15:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol - I feel like reading YC applications taught me this.  It‚Äôs so much more fun when you just believe the idea and worry about the execution.  It‚Äôs hard to do this over time.
946064225150976000 2017-12-27 17:04:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Sure - the only thing that allowed Twitch to happen was  http://Justin.tv¬† getting to profitability in year 4 and 5.  This involved both a layoff and realizing that investors weren‚Äôt going to rescue us.  We were 2 months from dead before we learned this lesson.
946063454074314752 2017-12-27 17:01:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Revenue, breakeven, DAUs, retention
945899620453851137 2017-12-27 06:10:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Maybe over 100k a month burn pre-product market fit?  Less is ideal...
945823774871453696 2017-12-27 01:08:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Ahh - yes - definitely referring to YC startups :)
945821373753995264 2017-12-27 00:59:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Sorry - I‚Äôm not sure I understand the point you are making.
945795747059941376 2017-12-26 23:17:32 +0100 <mwseibel> I think we do far more to help than hurt but of course you are entitled to your own opinion.  There isn‚Äôt only one path to startup success.
945746523215708160 2017-12-26 20:01:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Bad VCs yes - the best ones though can often avoid these temptations...
945741704694394882 2017-12-26 19:42:48 +0100 <mwseibel> FYI - I think hiring too quickly is one of the top 3 reasons why YC startups die.  This is an unfortunate side effect of how effective YC demo day is at helping companies raise money.
945738435922296832 2017-12-26 19:29:48 +0100 <mwseibel> Common false milestones: funding rounds, head count, GMV (with negative margins), LTV (with minimal data), brand name VC firm, early stage valuations, nice office, speaking at conferences (unless you can access your users there), hiring execs/VPs...
945737715307253761 2017-12-26 19:26:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Great founders tune out the startup scene and focus on their customers, their numbers, their health (mental@and physical) and their internal culture.
945737275782000640 2017-12-26 19:25:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Unfortunately the startup scene is a bit like high school.  A bunch of people chasing after false goals/milestones and caring too much about what their peers are doing and how they are perceived in the short term.
945736872642224128 2017-12-26 19:23:36 +0100 <mwseibel> ... I try to figure out how they can all become great.  Sometimes a smart team just needs to stay alive long enough to find their way to success.
945736164132077568 2017-12-26 19:20:47 +0100 <mwseibel> Since joining YC as a partner 3 years ago I‚Äôve seen over 600 companies participate in the program.  Most VCs spend time trying to figure out which ones will become great...
945735350588096512 2017-12-26 19:17:33 +0100 <mwseibel> Rereading PG essays reminds me how much easier it it to spot patterns of failure when you have worked with hundreds of startups instead of just one (your own).

945041299094216704 2017-12-24 21:19:38 +0100 <mwseibel> I think maybe you could build a media brand that monetizes 90%+ off of conferences.  Not sure - I‚Äôm not an expert but that might leave writers free to write about startups.

939920967916064768 2017-12-10 18:13:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Did you have a bad experience?
939565288831381504 2017-12-09 18:39:55 +0100 <mwseibel> then invest more money
939551115464491008 2017-12-09 17:43:36 +0100 <mwseibel> very small chance indeed...
939547536204840960 2017-12-09 17:29:23 +0100 <mwseibel> Why angel invest if your pockets aren't deep...?
939546895747137536 2017-12-09 17:26:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Seems like the answers to will you invest are: yes, no, give me x days to make a decision, or send me y information and I'll make a decision.
939546115245883392 2017-12-09 17:23:44 +0100 <mwseibel> I'll do half the round if you can find other investors to do the other half
939546010203779072 2017-12-09 17:23:19 +0100 <mwseibel> I'll invest if you find a lead
939545923595616256 2017-12-09 17:22:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Why do angel investors/angel firms say things like...
939168377154629633 2017-12-08 16:22:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Google/Gmail controls my email by filtering out messages that it doesn't think I should see. Generally I don't mind, but filtering out Hellosign and Docusign signature requests is pretty silly. The more this happens the more I realize how a previously open protocol is now closed.
938880999894654976 2017-12-07 21:20:48 +0100 <mwseibel> False choice - polite doesn‚Äôt mean untruthful
938879441396056064 2017-12-07 21:14:37 +0100 <mwseibel> First thing a founder should remember is to always be polite - we say this over and over again to each YC batch

912171383760633858 2017-09-25 05:26:19 +0100 <mwseibel> YC fall tour round round kicks off this week for me!  Boston then NYC :)
912129408105816064 2017-09-25 02:39:32 +0100 <mwseibel> Me too - just feel strange asking them when they really just want help with their companies - so I'm asking here instead
912128693182410752 2017-09-25 02:36:41 +0100 <mwseibel> Generally, I when talking to these founders I focus on helping them with their business (instead of asking them to help me with YC)
912128344405053440 2017-09-25 02:35:18 +0100 <mwseibel> As we continue to strive to make YC great,  I would like to understand what motivates a founder to seek a second accelerator.
912127634699456513 2017-09-25 02:32:29 +0100 <mwseibel> Many of these accelerators are the big names that everyone has heard of.
912127490163859456 2017-09-25 02:31:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Lots of recent participants of other accelerators have emailed me in the past week asking to participate in YC.
912030641973112832 2017-09-24 20:07:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Seriously!
912030334551597056 2017-09-24 20:05:51 +0100 <mwseibel> It was a Facebook ad we ran that got syndicated by their Audience Network. We shut off the Facebook ad as soon as we found out!

912028400306360320 2017-09-24 19:58:09 +0100 <mwseibel> Absolutely not
912028284895891458 2017-09-24 19:57:42 +0100 <mwseibel> No
912028213492072449 2017-09-24 19:57:25 +0100 <mwseibel> not sure what you mean...

907281207515275264 2017-09-11 17:34:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Good to know
907280559126147072 2017-09-11 17:31:56 +0100 <mwseibel> How would you guys feel if post money SAFEs became the new standard and wouldn't that cause an increase in caps?
907227397774127104 2017-09-11 14:00:41 +0100 <mwseibel> "less important" emails get answered faster than more important ones when they are easier to answer
907227214067900417 2017-09-11 13:59:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Usually the way I differentiate is how parseable/to the point is the email and how quickly can I answer.
907065266449768448 2017-09-11 03:16:26 +0100 <mwseibel> I try to help everyone who emails me
906891760428769281 2017-09-10 15:46:59 +0100 <mwseibel> YC at the @glaad gala last night - congrats @sama @ycombinator proudly supports the LGBTQ community pic.twitter.com/pindTANuRX
906889730083528704 2017-09-10 15:38:55 +0100 <mwseibel> This is so true! https://twitter.com/aplusk/status/906633176260292608¬†‚Ä¶
906889307939422209 2017-09-10 15:37:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Not sure if this is the best general strategy but it's the best one for getting value out of me
906889167904239617 2017-09-10 15:36:41 +0100 <mwseibel> When im engaged then I ask for higher bandwidth communication without being prompted - and then bingo relationship formed
906888976010579970 2017-09-10 15:35:55 +0100 <mwseibel> If they aren't willing to help - move on - if they are then with a few more back and forths - they will be engaged
906888727527428096 2017-09-10 15:34:56 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the best strategy is to for help in the lowest commitment way for the helper first.
906888399717416960 2017-09-10 15:33:38 +0100 <mwseibel> If they require not only assistance but to dictate the form that assistance is provided, then they have a lower chance of receiving any help
906888100420272128 2017-09-10 15:32:26 +0100 <mwseibel> My challenge is that the person asking for help (founder/potential business partner/investor) is the requester.
906290212942241792 2017-09-08 23:56:39 +0100 <mwseibel> geez - where ever you heard that - never go there again
906289792777781248 2017-09-08 23:54:59 +0100 <mwseibel> lol - unfortunately thats not how we work - but you can apply to YC:  http://www.ycombinator.com/apply/¬† (I answer this question 10 times a day)
906235223167393792 2017-09-08 20:18:08 +0100 <mwseibel> makes sense :)
906235080644861952 2017-09-08 20:17:34 +0100 <mwseibel> When to launch, what to build, how to raise money, whether to raise money, what YC is looking for in a company, etc. etc.
906234601571442688 2017-09-08 20:15:40 +0100 <mwseibel>  http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
906234455865540609 2017-09-08 20:15:05 +0100 <mwseibel> I don't think my time is more valuable - I just want to help as many people as possible per day.  Which is much easier over email :)
906234242308366336 2017-09-08 20:14:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Office hours are with existing YC companies / YC alums.
906234110925877248 2017-09-08 20:13:43 +0100 <mwseibel> I like saying yes!!!! :)
906190971745976321 2017-09-08 17:22:18 +0100 <mwseibel> Is it more human to meet in a month or never or to help someone directly within 5 minutes
906184789526429696 2017-09-08 16:57:44 +0100 <mwseibel> I totally do this as well - I'm about to start a 2.5 hr call block :)
906184487586848770 2017-09-08 16:56:32 +0100 <mwseibel> I don't mind building relationships but I love doing it by helping people with their problem right away...
906183881732194305 2017-09-08 16:54:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Helping founders is a job that I volunteered for - I'm happy to do it without them providing value to me
906183135439708160 2017-09-08 16:51:10 +0100 <mwseibel> But... what if you can't get the meeting?
906132076679708672 2017-09-08 13:28:16 +0100 <mwseibel> Over 50% of the first contact emails I receive get this reply.
906131954931613696 2017-09-08 13:27:47 +0100 <mwseibel> That is literally my most common email reply "how can I be helpful?"
906131692376645632 2017-09-08 13:26:45 +0100 <mwseibel> That so strange - there is so much actual work to do!!!
906131601674846208 2017-09-08 13:26:23 +0100 <mwseibel> But based on my email I suspect it's possible that there are many people whose primary job is requesting and then attending meetings.
906131280416227329 2017-09-08 13:25:07 +0100 <mwseibel> With startup founders I'm often happy to steer them into simply telling me how I can help.  That is part of my job.
906130692311990272 2017-09-08 13:22:46 +0100 <mwseibel> Finally - why do people assume that with 2 weeks notice your schedule is completely free for meetings?
906130456717926400 2017-09-08 13:21:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Also why do people want to wait to ask for something till they are in town for a meeting - that seems super slow!
906130214270320640 2017-09-08 13:20:52 +0100 <mwseibel> In most cases the meeting is the least efficient way to get help.  The exception for me is office hours - which are much better in person.
906129898133000194 2017-09-08 13:19:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Why do people want to meet instead of just asking for what they want?  I love being helpful - I hate having to attend an hour meeting.
905543784431099904 2017-09-06 22:30:37 +0100 <mwseibel> Why can't people send K-1s as attachments?  All this crappy software for managing investors in small funds is so frustrating!!!!
905541775443492864 2017-09-06 22:22:38 +0100 <mwseibel> @GiftCards_com your website isn't working....
905432075590811648 2017-09-06 15:06:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Killing DACA is stupid - giving it to a congress who can't get anything done is killing it. I don't recognize the country I live in anymore. https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/905141484386750469¬†‚Ä¶

899763473411788800 2017-08-21 23:41:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Interesting thought. We actively recruit investors from under-represented backgrounds but we don't ask people for their sex or background...
899762292862009345 2017-08-21 23:37:02 +0100 <mwseibel> Over 550 investors have checked into YC demo day today #ycdemoday @ycombinator
899759147964448768 2017-08-21 23:24:32 +0100 <mwseibel> And more than half of our investments are in the past 5 years :)
899753267004981248 2017-08-21 23:01:10 +0100 <mwseibel> This is typically the case
899753128223940608 2017-08-21 23:00:37 +0100 <mwseibel> We track this informally and are seeing a proportionate number of under-represented founders applying as get in. My goal: more applications!

896878198985605120 2017-08-14 00:36:40 +0100 <mwseibel> sure - my email is in my twitter profile
896759086884151297 2017-08-13 16:43:21 +0100 <mwseibel> You should be actively recruiting these people and giving them a clear understanding of the career path within your firm.
896758896743694336 2017-08-13 16:42:36 +0100 <mwseibel> They are doing this because the path into most VC firms is unclear and they fear being the "jr partner" with no investment authority...
896758566962450432 2017-08-13 16:41:17 +0100 <mwseibel> VCs take note: I know a number of minority/female investors that would make great partners but instead are raising their own seed funds
895684777486962688 2017-08-10 17:34:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Thanks!
895684671949881350 2017-08-10 17:34:01 +0100 <mwseibel> @ask_trim my old EA setup an account for me and never sent me the username and password, now I'm getting the txts but cannot login
895667118494015490 2017-08-10 16:24:16 +0100 <mwseibel> No such thing as a lead investor when investing in the early this is depreciated - find and lead and I'm in = no
895663644196851712 2017-08-10 16:10:28 +0100 <mwseibel> This is publically available information - also most good angel's can give perfectly good advice on this front
895663442882813953 2017-08-10 16:09:40 +0100 <mwseibel> AngelList!
895663356547182592 2017-08-10 16:09:19 +0100 <mwseibel> If you remember that a maybe or let's talk ina couple months is actually a no - then you won't let investors waste your time
895663024320561153 2017-08-10 16:08:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Being a good founder requires focus - for most early stage companies - networking with VCs is not a top 5 priority
895662353051602944 2017-08-10 16:05:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Often times the best case is that you building something that people love and the Series A VCs chase you!
895662203814072320 2017-08-10 16:04:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Understand this: Series A VCs are rarely the on ramp into the tech world or initial funding
895661779153371137 2017-08-10 16:03:03 +0100 <mwseibel> Just email them and tell them about your startup - https://blog.ycombinator.com/how-to-email-early-stage-investors/¬†‚Ä¶
895661560529534977 2017-08-10 16:02:11 +0100 <mwseibel> If you can't find angels/early stage funds - search AngelList or Crunchbase... it's not that hard to find these people.
895661206823780353 2017-08-10 16:00:46 +0100 <mwseibel> It's not cool to spend a bunch of time networking with investors - it's cool to work on your product and talk to customers.
895661042759487489 2017-08-10 16:00:07 +0100 <mwseibel> They are much more likely to write early checks - also they often move faster.
895660827490959360 2017-08-10 15:59:16 +0100 <mwseibel> No offense to the VCs but early stage founders you should be reaching out to angels and seed funds!!!!
895660529615642629 2017-08-10 15:58:05 +0100 <mwseibel> So many founders I meet think that "networking" with Series A VCs is the most important thing to do to raise money... pic.twitter.com/N5DCOvVOrx
895654921390899201 2017-08-10 15:35:48 +0100 <mwseibel> I had a great time hosting the @Code2040 fellows at @ycombinator  SF office last night - I'm sure I met some future YC founders pic.twitter.com/PYXwS7OoLI

894915435757322240 2017-08-08 14:37:21 +0100 <mwseibel> The longer you are somewhere the harder it is to move.

894783451051708416 2017-08-08 05:52:53 +0100 <mwseibel> Harder to build a billion dollar tech company outside of the Bay Area (not impossible but harder)
894718946338676740 2017-08-08 01:36:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Its getting harder :(
894706873865076740 2017-08-08 00:48:36 +0100 <mwseibel> I wish we could go back to the America where we felt like our government was fighting for the common good.
894706644872863744 2017-08-08 00:47:41 +0100 <mwseibel> I realized I'm not pissed because I never really expected the government to be helpful in the first place...
894706454552166401 2017-08-08 00:46:56 +0100 <mwseibel> The rule that would have made it easier for foreign founders who raise money to stay and grow their businesses in the US...
894706309064343552 2017-08-08 00:46:21 +0100 <mwseibel> I was trying to figure out why I wasn't more pissed about Trump killing the International Entrepreneur Rule....

894692150302003200 2017-08-07 23:50:05 +0100 <mwseibel> When emailing someone for help/advice/etc your first ask should almost never be for a meeting.... just explain what you need help with!
894686058004094976 2017-08-07 23:25:53 +0100 <mwseibel> often this means you aren't asking for the right thing or in the right way - check this out: http://www.michaelseibel.com/blog/how-to-ask-for-advice¬†‚Ä¶
894680885949120512 2017-08-07 23:05:20 +0100 <mwseibel> No extra credit is given to people who don't ask for help.  One reason why the valley is different is that we try to help one another.
894680520927227906 2017-08-07 23:03:53 +0100 <mwseibel> Successful people are happy to help you if you reach out and ask - its much better to climb on other people's shoulders to get ahead...
894680344921649153 2017-08-07 23:03:11 +0100 <mwseibel> Tip for young people in the valley (especially new comers and underrepresented folks) - you don't have to do everything by yourself...

888477952647680001 2017-07-21 20:17:05 +0100 <mwseibel> It's actually a lot more big company news than I remembered
888476732566589440 2017-07-21 20:12:14 +0100 <mwseibel> @JoshConstine I've been reading the TC archives to remember my old days as a founder - very interesting! https://techcrunch.com/page/8202/¬†
888467000405536768 2017-07-21 19:33:34 +0100 <mwseibel> Good to know!
888466024705662976 2017-07-21 19:29:41 +0100 <mwseibel> ahh... okay I understand.  In what cases would you recommend a company to talk to TC over just submitting to product hunt / hackernews?
888465532667568128 2017-07-21 19:27:44 +0100 <mwseibel> Sorry what I meant to say is that if money is a significant factor in the story being written.
888465180249563136 2017-07-21 19:26:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Startups typically only raise money once every 2 years - so if money has to be attached... can they only expect a story every 2 years?
888460937891528704 2017-07-21 19:09:29 +0100 <mwseibel> I wonder if there is a structural problem here - cause my gut is that tech reporters would rather write product stories too no?
888460704507805696 2017-07-21 19:08:33 +0100 <mwseibel> I think tech reporters are pretty smart - it feels like there might be a structural problem here.
888460582549995521 2017-07-21 19:08:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Is it really true that xyz company raising $2m from angels gets more clicks then xyz launches new product?
888460340958117889 2017-07-21 19:07:06 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes but when did tech news become financial news... these are startups not fortune 500 companies right?
888460234632581123 2017-07-21 19:06:41 +0100 <mwseibel> XYZ company launched this product today - or released these new features today
888459469331472384 2017-07-21 19:03:38 +0100 <mwseibel> As a large consumer of tech news, I much prefer to read product launch stories over fundraising stories.
888459246471307264 2017-07-21 19:02:45 +0100 <mwseibel> More and more I hear from YC companies that tech reporters only want to write startup fundraising stories.  Is that true?  If so why?

887156283555463170 2017-07-18 04:45:15 +0100 <mwseibel> If you stay small you can start where your users are and move to SF if/when you get some traction
887156140848463876 2017-07-18 04:44:41 +0100 <mwseibel> I think SF is still the best place to base you company but might not be where you want to get your initial user base.

884037231857377282 2017-07-09 14:11:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Thank you for your post :)
880816265165656065 2017-06-30 16:52:17 +0100 <mwseibel> It's counterintuitive and I think it's one of the secrets of the startup community.  It very hard to see his happening from the outside.
880815803741872128 2017-06-30 16:50:27 +0100 <mwseibel> There is something about the impossible challenge of running a startup that causes the people around you to want to lend a hand.
880815279059591170 2017-06-30 16:48:21 +0100 <mwseibel> Just wanted to say thank you again!
880815184691904512 2017-06-30 16:47:59 +0100 <mwseibel> He did it again 5 years ago at @socialcam - even though when I reached out he was on vacation
880815005532266496 2017-06-30 16:47:16 +0100 <mwseibel> After helping out I remembered 10 years ago when  http://Justin.tv¬† was struggling and @jeffbarr from @awscloud got us out of a jam
880814469135294466 2017-06-30 16:45:08 +0100 <mwseibel> There is a great early stage YC company having a problem with some of their hardware and asking for advice...

879726045242417152 2017-06-27 16:40:08 +0100 <mwseibel> I typically describe the chances of building a billion dollar company like the chances of getting into the NBA
879725900152971264 2017-06-27 16:39:33 +0100 <mwseibel> I like to emphasize this point with founders because I want them to know how hard it is upfront
879725658649239552 2017-06-27 16:38:36 +0100 <mwseibel> I think the real number are that 99% of startups fail - defining failure as not making the founders some significant amount of money
879725426330877952 2017-06-27 16:37:40 +0100 <mwseibel> Great column - unfortunately the vast majority of startups never receive funding from a VC :(
879545940952076288 2017-06-27 04:44:28 +0100 <mwseibel> :)
879530558673403904 2017-06-27 03:43:20 +0100 <mwseibel> Is it okay that minorities/gays etc now have to leave town in order to eat?
879530433343438848 2017-06-27 03:42:50 +0100 <mwseibel> What if all the restaurants/grocery stores in town now call themselves bakeries?  Most of them already bake many items daily.

875897263079342080 2017-06-17 03:05:55 +0100 <mwseibel> Very true
875897072574058496 2017-06-17 03:05:10 +0100 <mwseibel> I remember that conversation <grin>
875834181317566464 2017-06-16 22:55:15 +0100 <mwseibel> Shout out to @makinde & @devcolororg - thank you for the referral to the YC software team!
875568173201752064 2017-06-16 05:18:14 +0100 <mwseibel> Lol
875558876040515584 2017-06-16 04:41:17 +0100 <mwseibel> How do I know if an idea is legit?  I may have an opinion but you should be more of an expert on the problem you are solving than I.
875546742497746944 2017-06-16 03:53:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Great founders don't use YC to decide whether their startup is good.  They keep working on their startup no matter what. #therightstuff
875546287600394240 2017-06-16 03:51:16 +0100 <mwseibel> nice!!! pic.twitter.com/hNcdpFDzug
875545183554682880 2017-06-16 03:46:53 +0100 <mwseibel> @garrytan is a boss!  Also, nice work sir!
875542725076033536 2017-06-16 03:37:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Meet a company at YC interviews. They're rejected. Give them feedback. They stay in touch. Make progress. Now at break even. #therightstuff
875533242174021632 2017-06-16 02:59:26 +0100 <mwseibel> lol - you are right - we tell that to founders all the time - x axis is time - y axis is probably confidence level
875229066328027136 2017-06-15 06:50:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Talk to users, write code, keep burn low

874347497853861889 2017-06-12 20:27:42 +0100 <mwseibel> drop me an email with your deck or last investor update - michael@ycombinator.com
874347245813997568 2017-06-12 20:26:42 +0100 <mwseibel> ... in all situations - I would have no advice at all.
874347110652493825 2017-06-12 20:26:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Well it's harder to start some startups than others...  Seems like if I limited my advice to things that would only help all startups...
874346753683668992 2017-06-12 20:24:45 +0100 <mwseibel> This isn't a path for everyone - but it should be considered by everyone - that is why I'm Tweeting about it :)
874346617519742976 2017-06-12 20:24:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Sure but paying customers can... often times a lot quicker than investors - especially for first time founders outside of the bay area
874346365576331264 2017-06-12 20:23:12 +0100 <mwseibel> you are the CEO - its your call - my advice is use @clerkyinc if you can
874289174160957440 2017-06-12 16:35:57 +0100 <mwseibel> Who are your lawyers?  Almost all YC companies use Clerky...
874015278622924800 2017-06-11 22:27:35 +0100 <mwseibel> if its possible - move here
874012152939520000 2017-06-11 22:15:10 +0100 <mwseibel> Why is it so hard to get lawyers to use Hellosign / Docusign or some other type of electronic signature product.  #waitingfordistruption
874005913647980544 2017-06-11 21:50:22 +0100 <mwseibel> launch
874005793212735488 2017-06-11 21:49:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Dude - I totally agree - the best way to raise money is to not need it :)
874005584130957312 2017-06-11 21:49:04 +0100 <mwseibel> No tricks - depends on the product and how often your customer has the problem you are solving
874005446033461248 2017-06-11 21:48:31 +0100 <mwseibel> talk to users, write code
874005324360859648 2017-06-11 21:48:02 +0100 <mwseibel> raise money in the bay area
873914941991931904 2017-06-11 15:48:53 +0100 <mwseibel> Don't care as much about how you got the customer.  I care how much they love the product.
873746093393051648 2017-06-11 04:37:56 +0100 <mwseibel> Well how do you define meaningful traction?
873703656553463808 2017-06-11 01:49:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Also your MVP doesn't have to be complicated - feel free to make your v1 unscalable - as long as it addresses a real customer problem
873703301480554496 2017-06-11 01:47:54 +0100 <mwseibel> Ideas don't give you much leverage over investors, customers do!
873703172878999552 2017-06-11 01:47:23 +0100 <mwseibel> You will have more success if you come up with an idea, build an mvp, get a couple customers and then try to raise money.
873703085054361601 2017-06-11 01:47:02 +0100 <mwseibel> That isn't always the best order...
873702844834078720 2017-06-11 01:46:05 +0100 <mwseibel> At some point someone has probably told you that startups come up with an idea, raise money, build, and then get customers...

861635674088157184 2017-05-08 18:35:27 +0100 <mwseibel> Consistently the biggest email mistake I made in the past was asking for a meeting to ask for something - instead of just asking directly.
858733517219418112 2017-04-30 18:23:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Just drop me an email - email address on my twitter profile

854830851233689600 2017-04-19 23:55:31 +0100 <mwseibel> nicely done!
854629160454508544 2017-04-19 10:34:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Your revolutionary thoughts are going to get you in trouble!
854107290898583552 2017-04-18 00:00:21 +0100 <mwseibel> They have a ton of YC applicants...
854061577804197889 2017-04-17 20:58:42 +0100 <mwseibel> Drop me an email michael@ycombinator.com - tons of your students are applying to YC
853971117337321474 2017-04-17 14:59:15 +0100 <mwseibel> michael@ycombinator.com
853971049414762497 2017-04-17 14:58:58 +0100 <mwseibel> michael@ycombinator.com
853887303466401793 2017-04-17 09:26:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Wow - that is disheartening because their students surely know about YC - how do we change that?
853887123853721600 2017-04-17 09:25:29 +0100 <mwseibel> My email is in my twitter profile - reach out!
853886708185677826 2017-04-17 09:23:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Here is a YC company trying to do just that:  https://www.makeschool.com/¬† @JeremyRossmann
853510750966616064 2017-04-16 08:29:55 +0100 <mwseibel> I hope the same rule applies in the business school world
853510237273432064 2017-04-16 08:27:52 +0100 <mwseibel> In the startup world the best founders/investors want to be told when they should be looking at something in a different way.
853510145258782720 2017-04-16 08:27:30 +0100 <mwseibel> Maybe that is why everyone says those two are the best.
853509517291737088 2017-04-16 08:25:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Since tweeting about B schools failing their students who want to start startups, HBS and Stanford have reached out. Everyone else silent...
852825867008958465 2017-04-14 11:08:26 +0100 <mwseibel> :)
851542009970032642 2017-04-10 22:06:50 +0100 <mwseibel> Summer class
851541958342438913 2017-04-10 22:06:38 +0100 <mwseibel> Nope
851513828277968897 2017-04-10 20:14:51 +0100 <mwseibel> It's a shame - there is so much talent going to waste in business schools right now!
851513691417833472 2017-04-10 20:14:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Business schools students should be old enough to make decisions by themselves
851513611814146050 2017-04-10 20:14:00 +0100 <mwseibel> Yes! If you want to start a tech company - skip business school and just do  http://startupschool.org¬† - use the money you save on your startup
851510281704439808 2017-04-10 20:00:46 +0100 <mwseibel>  http://startupclass.samaltman.com/¬†
851510222757744640 2017-04-10 20:00:32 +0100 <mwseibel> If any MBA wants a different perspective just read PG essays and watch how to start a startup:  http://startupclass.samaltman.com/¬†
851509838307889153 2017-04-10 19:59:00 +0100 <mwseibel> It's depressing because you can see that this is a case of smart people being given bad advice - even in the Bay Area
851509668425998336 2017-04-10 19:58:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Constantly seeing smart MBAs conducting surveys, not committing, not recruiting technical cofounders, and not building and launching mvps.
851509298521944064 2017-04-10 19:56:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Reading YC applications and observing that business schools are doing a criminally poor job of prepping students to start tech companies
850922336970842114 2017-04-09 05:04:29 +0100 <mwseibel> At YC we want to fund strong teams solving large problems
850922145081372673 2017-04-09 05:03:43 +0100 <mwseibel> The signal you are picking up is that founders of different backgrounds are often interested in problems that the valley typically ignores
850921832807112704 2017-04-09 05:02:28 +0100 <mwseibel> With that being said is it harder for a minority founder in the valley to succeed - often times yes!
850921271743393793 2017-04-09 05:00:15 +0100 <mwseibel> A online ticketing company in Mexico as well as a coffee selling company in Europe
850921119100137472 2017-04-09 04:59:38 +0100 <mwseibel> We funded a grocery delivery company in Columbia - does that fit this thesis as well?
850920948798828544 2017-04-09 04:58:58 +0100 <mwseibel> I think this might be a case of drawing a conclusion and then trying to find facts to support the case.
850920800760758272 2017-04-09 04:58:22 +0100 <mwseibel> Blacks are not a minority in Nigeria - also Flip is a sneaker marketplace - last time I checked people of every race wear sneakers
850920463106756608 2017-04-09 04:57:02 +0100 <mwseibel> I don't think the phrase minority issues because it doesn't seem to describe a company that is providing internet to Nigerians
850496773873336320 2017-04-08 00:53:27 +0100 <mwseibel> I really like that explanation - thank you!
850401364597395456 2017-04-07 18:34:19 +0100 <mwseibel> Internally built software is a competitive advantage a shocking number of large investors aren't reaching for.
850400653503381504 2017-04-07 18:31:30 +0100 <mwseibel> If you provide some specific examples I can also speak more intelligently to your concerns
850400544543784960 2017-04-07 18:31:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Also how would you classify startups like Paystack, Flutterwave, and  http://Wifi.com.ng¬†?
850400214900916226 2017-04-07 18:29:45 +0100 <mwseibel> Is that a bad thing?
850156311295565825 2017-04-07 02:20:34 +0100 <mwseibel> alright - back to application reading!  thanks for asking the question!

781107791826157569 2016-09-28 13:26:24 +0100 <mwseibel> yes! Especially if they are software engineering interns
781107623651381249 2016-09-28 13:25:44 +0100 <mwseibel> best skill is resilience - startups are tough work
781107428796530688 2016-09-28 13:24:57 +0100 <mwseibel> I think this is a great time to start in Nigeria - especially if you can raise USD and YC invests with USD
781105202665517057 2016-09-28 13:16:07 +0100 <mwseibel> I don't have a perfect count but I believe over 8
781105061158064128 2016-09-28 13:15:33 +0100 <mwseibel> what you do, traction, market size, unique insight, business model, team, ask
781103846064025600 2016-09-28 13:10:43 +0100 <mwseibel> it really depends - can you work with someone who already has the license?
781102977855713280 2016-09-28 13:07:16 +0100 <mwseibel> the most valuable thing YC provides is a community of founders and partners who support your efforts to grow and scale

771052717162663936 2016-08-31 19:31:07 +0100 <mwseibel> I'm sorry you feel insulted after I've explained how I felt after reading your tweets - not my intention
771052164307300352 2016-08-31 19:28:56 +0100 <mwseibel> with Justine we were experimenting with whether we could support multiple shows "lifecasts" - there was never any romantic goal
771051960912883712 2016-08-31 19:28:07 +0100 <mwseibel> wow! I guess something got lost in translation - Justin's goal for the show was to show the startup world from the inside
771050341617979392 2016-08-31 19:21:41 +0100 <mwseibel> - this isn't the way to motivate the people who are fighting for changes that you believe in
771050169798238208 2016-08-31 19:21:00 +0100 <mwseibel> it doesn't feel great to be attacked when you are trying to make a difference
771049577214377984 2016-08-31 19:18:39 +0100 <mwseibel> @ninavizz I agree with you that we need increase diversity in the tech world - this is something I work on everyday
771048409427877888 2016-08-31 19:14:00 +0100 <mwseibel> sounds like you're saying I was the janitor...
771048263734611968 2016-08-31 19:13:26 +0100 <mwseibel> Which woman are you referring to here?

770993053020532736 2016-08-31 15:34:02 +0100 <mwseibel> :( I didn't think we were THAT bad...  Also we were kinda diverse right?  Jew, Asian, Black, White...

765985810545946625 2016-08-17 19:57:03 +0100 <mwseibel> totally agree its a strategic choice to make when a customer is asking you to pivot - something worth thinking about
765979015949582336 2016-08-17 19:30:03 +0100 <mwseibel> true for all different types of startups in my experience - what do you think?

753610570041995264 2016-07-14 16:22:15 +0100 <mwseibel> I think we hurt the debate by participating in the 24 hr news cycle - what do you think the next president should to help America?
753609668044296192 2016-07-14 16:18:40 +0100 <mwseibel> - the real issue is that many Americans don't see a path to economic prosperity and our government has no response
753609335708659712 2016-07-14 16:17:21 +0100 <mwseibel> most voters don't know who she is - the people watching it on the news have already made up their minds
753586167900213248 2016-07-14 14:45:18 +0100 <mwseibel> this was my laugh for the morning - d trump is the republican nominee - and RBG is what we are talking about?!?

723665959798480896 2016-04-23 01:13:04 +0100 <mwseibel> Sweet podcast on the early days of JTV http://pca.st/1gly¬†
723196006876082177 2016-04-21 18:05:39 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo @TechCrunch wife's birthday ruined and after 3 weeks can't even get a refund - this company is basically a fraud
723195594219483136 2016-04-21 18:04:00 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo the I was told just to wait - @TechCrunch if you want a sorry about horrible customer service I've got a great one for you
723195399041732608 2016-04-21 18:03:14 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo it took me 45 minutes to find a number to contact customer service - had to pretend I was a ticket seller
723195128098082821 2016-04-21 18:02:09 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo order number 6797028 - I was told at the time that I would get a full refund and 50% credit - I've gotten neither
723194808919937024 2016-04-21 18:00:53 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo in the newest development it's been almost 3 weeks since El Classico and I still haven't been issued a refund for the fake tickets
722974880669401088 2016-04-21 03:26:58 +0100 <mwseibel> First half of YC interviews complete - this is looking like a fearsome batch #ycs2016
722281712462405632 2016-04-19 05:32:34 +0100 <mwseibel> @quip01 :( - I never learned to write code
720311659642757121 2016-04-13 19:04:17 +0100 <mwseibel> @DiegoArielRios I went to Bogota in 2015 - I've gotta go back soon!
720308961824473089 2016-04-13 18:53:33 +0100 <mwseibel> Heading to Mexico City today!  So excited to be hosted by @ITAM_mx
719695747860398081 2016-04-12 02:16:52 +0100 <mwseibel> If you didn't get a YC interview this time - keep on the grind!!! A many many many companies don't get in on their first or even second app
719695460785467392 2016-04-12 02:15:43 +0100 <mwseibel> YC interview invites just went out - congrats to all the companies who are coming to interviews
718099748511727616 2016-04-07 16:34:56 +0100 <mwseibel> @cvander in Mexico City next week - excited to meet some great founders!
717017217221656582 2016-04-04 16:53:20 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo your customer service person is doing everything she can to make sure it works out so "fingers crossed"
717017090834702336 2016-04-04 16:52:50 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo 6731536 - I now have direct contact info for my seller and we are planning to meet tomorrow 1 hr before the match
717005723885047808 2016-04-04 16:07:40 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo I really hope I don't have the same problem again...
717005084882833408 2016-04-04 16:05:08 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo your team is also trying to make sure my tickets for tomorrow's CL game in Barcelona are will be at the drop off point
717004664458358784 2016-04-04 16:03:27 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo the customer service manager offer a refund & 50% voucher my el Classico tickets, I'll never use viagogo again so the voucher = 0
716968715087187969 2016-04-04 13:40:36 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo calling into your customer service now to figure out next steps...
716360338107531265 2016-04-02 21:23:08 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo I think we found 3 different scam artists on your site in about 3hrs - lol
716360222357360640 2016-04-02 21:22:40 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo then he next set of tickets you gave us got us past the first guard but when we tried to scan them... They had already been used
716360046951567360 2016-04-02 21:21:59 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo then the new tickets you gave us were for a different game... The stadium guard at Camp Nou pointed that out
716359879426846720 2016-04-02 21:21:19 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo first at the hotel ticket drop off which didn't have the tickets - no one bothered to contact us about that...
716359609489825792 2016-04-02 21:20:14 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo it doesn't help that this was a birthday gift for my wife and we spent 3 hrs running around the area outside the stadium
716358780187910144 2016-04-02 21:16:57 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo to be honest not even sure what to ask them for - at this point I just want to go home #tripruined
716358565443665920 2016-04-02 21:16:05 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo at this point I'm afraid to use a voucher cause I'm pretty sure any game I want I'm going to scammed again
716358274233184256 2016-04-02 21:14:56 +0100 <mwseibel> @AirbnbHelp thank you for the offer but you guys didn't do anything wrong @airbnb is amazing @viagogo is something else
716357909865562112 2016-04-02 21:13:29 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo last week I bought 3 more sets of tickets on @viagogo for champions league games this week and Barca game next weekend...
716357688309866496 2016-04-02 21:12:36 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo a patient customer service person tried to help but no dice - can can't cover travel costs and want to give me a "voucher"
716357380980604928 2016-04-02 21:11:23 +0100 <mwseibel> @viagogo on phone with customer service for over 2 hours - staff at Camp Nou laughed at me for trying to use @viagogo
716357063916412928 2016-04-02 21:10:07 +0100 <mwseibel> #stupid American - thought I could buy tickets to el Classico with @viagogo - got ripped off twice - I'm out travel and Airbnb expenses
716207682135285760 2016-04-02 11:16:32 +0100 <mwseibel> @markstraub lol!!!!
715948276646719489 2016-04-01 18:05:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @ZuberoaMarcos @harper I think tonight we are looking to do a tapas crawl :)

715934925766012930 2016-04-01 17:12:42 +0100 <mwseibel> @phobeo @DrinkaboutBCN - we can try to stop by - which bar?

715891427557793792 2016-04-01 14:19:51 +0100 <mwseibel> Uber!  You used to be in Barcelona - what happened?
714941398617722880 2016-03-29 23:24:47 +0100 <mwseibel> @annawiener nice piece on YC demo day, great job job showing off the variety of companies in the YC W2016 batch  http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/the-future-of-silicon-valley/475818/¬†‚Ä¶
714653608172630016 2016-03-29 04:21:12 +0100 <mwseibel> Reading YC apps like crazy!!!!  So many interesting and new ideas...

710524804038676480 2016-03-17 17:54:48 +0100 <mwseibel> @HaishaChen @ycombinator really good advice for YC applicants!
709627245103439872 2016-03-15 06:28:14 +0100 <mwseibel> @sama it's the @justinkan effect #trendsetter
709178452545437696 2016-03-14 00:44:53 +0100 <mwseibel> @paulg I think is really hard to make an investor excited - provide facts and vision and let the investor excite themselves (or not)
709177936432078848 2016-03-14 00:42:50 +0100 <mwseibel> @paulg this is literally what I tell startups all the time - took me a long time to learn this lesson
708542043308449792 2016-03-12 06:36:01 +0100 <mwseibel> So much fun celebrating with Kyle, Daniel, and all the old Yscraper crew #jtvmafia #ycforlife
708355825002123264 2016-03-11 18:16:03 +0100 <mwseibel> @nabeel JTV mafia - who know that would be a thing?

625899436552663040 2015-07-28 06:23:48 +0100 <mwseibel> @ninavizz I agree - I'm open to suggestions on how to do this better.  We certainly we want to listen to our users.
625800123965153280 2015-07-27 23:49:11 +0100 <mwseibel> @octal also - most MVPs only require generalists
625799882977202176 2015-07-27 23:48:13 +0100 <mwseibel> @octal very true! I'm finding it is hard to communicate a completely accurate thought in 140 characters - shooting for 95% accurate :)
625799590579707905 2015-07-27 23:47:03 +0100 <mwseibel> @ramansrivastav anyway to cut the burn and get to MVP without raising?

625798910007750656 2015-07-27 23:44:21 +0100 <mwseibel> @ninavizz @sama @ycombinator yes I emailed Kathryn on July 20th
625798670076805120 2015-07-27 23:43:24 +0100 <mwseibel> @ninavizz I agree its a small amount of money - hopefully enough to get an mvp launched and raise more - not enough for years of runway
625798186037284865 2015-07-27 23:41:28 +0100 <mwseibel> @dcurtis Agreed! - but who teaches good marketing speak?  And is this a topic an early founder should spend time to learning?
625797873259692033 2015-07-27 23:40:14 +0100 <mwseibel> @JoshuaOgundu not yet... but soon!
625797782880829440 2015-07-27 23:39:52 +0100 <mwseibel> @ramansrivastav that is a tough spot, in startups just like the NBA, sometimes there isn't a good answer - advisors should acknowledge this
625797301622153216 2015-07-27 23:37:58 +0100 <mwseibel> Strip all marketing speech from the description of your company.  It's impossible to sell me if I don't understand what you are selling.
625796591170002944 2015-07-27 23:35:08 +0100 <mwseibel> Chicken or the egg? Investor or tech co-founder? Most often tech co-founder comes first.  Not sure about the chicken or the egg...
625796308901711872 2015-07-27 23:34:01 +0100 <mwseibel> Once you have a team in place - build and launch an MVP - its much harder to raise money without a launched MVP
625796104236474368 2015-07-27 23:33:12 +0100 <mwseibel> If you need a tech co-founder make a list of the top 5 tech people you know and ask them to join as equal partners - make them say yes or no
625795821729132544 2015-07-27 23:32:05 +0100 <mwseibel> Two big mistakes I see founders making: outsourcing tech or giving the tech co-founder too little equity, these are huge investor red flags
625794640986394624 2015-07-27 23:27:23 +0100 <mwseibel> @lmenus @paulg congrats!

625780377551040512 2015-07-27 22:30:43 +0100 <mwseibel> Often a meeting isn't the goal, it's to get feedback or an intro.  If you wait for a meeting to make the ask, you might never get a chance.

575011859905937408 2015-03-09 19:14:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @KedreonCole not a problem
575011621610786816 2015-03-09 19:13:48 +0100 <mwseibel> @LiveBeatApp @blackfounders I agree, but there are many minorities who can do a startup financially but don't - I need to change their minds
575011302248067073 2015-03-09 19:12:32 +0100 <mwseibel> @xianamoy - yes but its harder - single technical founder is easier than single non-tech
575010885988524032 2015-03-09 19:10:53 +0100 <mwseibel> @elenawalom @thashadow - please do :)
575010698142486528 2015-03-09 19:10:08 +0100 <mwseibel> @tdoogles @blackfounders - well I spend a hell of a lot of time talking to and recruiting minority founders
575010542844170240 2015-03-09 19:09:31 +0100 <mwseibel> @dre7413 @blackfounders nope - you can go back home after YC if you'd like
575010042539212800 2015-03-09 19:07:31 +0100 <mwseibel> @toryhargro @john_dry @blackfounders unfortunately we cannot choose where the hub is - we just have to go there
575009687839449088 2015-03-09 19:06:07 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator This was so much fun - I look forward to doing it again - #AskYCMichael
575009304983420928 2015-03-09 19:04:36 +0100 <mwseibel> @cavaughn @LekanB @blackfounders once I understand what the product is and why the market is big - I'm much more interested in your story
575009097377955840 2015-03-09 19:03:46 +0100 <mwseibel> @CodedByCam - why do you need more tech - just build a simpler MVP (minimal viable product) and launch
575008905853411328 2015-03-09 19:03:00 +0100 <mwseibel> @dre7413 @blackfounders YES YES YES - more than 10% of the batch is international
575008812400168960 2015-03-09 19:02:38 +0100 <mwseibel> @crissysmiless - we need more AA female founders - Tiffany is kicking ass in this batch of YC @DETwaterproject
575008649761849344 2015-03-09 19:01:59 +0100 <mwseibel> @JamoneK @elenawalom @beLaurie love it!

575008516252938240 2015-03-09 19:01:28 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @LekanB @blackfounders - true - the best way to demonstrate that you are a good team is through your actions no?
575008356139565056 2015-03-09 19:00:49 +0100 <mwseibel> @AustinLAC @blackfounders time of acceptance, its not a talent issue, tons of minority talent - its an information and access issue
575007939007619072 2015-03-09 18:59:10 +0100 <mwseibel> @toryhargro @john_dry @blackfounders - using savings and going all in full time
575007828550623232 2015-03-09 18:58:44 +0100 <mwseibel> @LekanB @blackfounders it is secondary to clear product description, big market, strong team, and good traction
575007705179389952 2015-03-09 18:58:14 +0100 <mwseibel> @LekanB @blackfounders - not very important - to many pitches focus too hard on this :(
575007522890780672 2015-03-09 18:57:31 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders - alumni come back to do office hours all the time and also continue to lean on their batch mates / the alumni network
575007080219725824 2015-03-09 18:55:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @AustinLAC @blackfounders - my goal is to make sure that minority founders who do YC are indistinguishable from others in terms of talent
575006500315250688 2015-03-09 18:53:27 +0100 <mwseibel> @AngelDCardinal @blackfounders - strong team, strong product, good growth
575006166859677696 2015-03-09 18:52:07 +0100 <mwseibel> Doing an AMA with @blackfounders - please feel free to ask me anything :) #AskYCMichael
575005635298729985 2015-03-09 18:50:01 +0100 <mwseibel> @john_dry @blackfounders - bootstrapping to ramen profitable is the second best path
575005488955293696 2015-03-09 18:49:26 +0100 <mwseibel> @hirokibacardi - why is it hard to find your user demo?
575005364388634624 2015-03-09 18:48:56 +0100 <mwseibel> @john_dry @blackfounders - minorities who work in well paying jobs today and who are interested in startups should be saving that money!
575005117600002048 2015-03-09 18:47:57 +0100 <mwseibel> @iBibleStory build a cheaper demo - you are creating the barrier
575004948754141184 2015-03-09 18:47:17 +0100 <mwseibel> @crissysmiless - I'd like to see many more - there are huge opportunities and I think the valley has a blind spot in this area
575004731346583552 2015-03-09 18:46:25 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders - it excludes tons of people of every race - its not the only path - but at some point you are going to have to go fulltime
575004565168238593 2015-03-09 18:45:46 +0100 <mwseibel> @JamoneK @elenawalom - for software engineers - work super hard - aspire to be a great coder - and reach out to me michael@ycombinator.com
575004267632726016 2015-03-09 18:44:35 +0100 <mwseibel> @chadchizzle @blackfounders @ycombinator - yes - even if a potential competitor has done YC - that isn't a reason not to apply
575004108140105728 2015-03-09 18:43:57 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders - It allows you to work full time on your startup - its hard to convince others to back you if you aren't all in
575003850781782016 2015-03-09 18:42:55 +0100 <mwseibel> @PowerMovesNOLA strength of the team - both relationship wise and technically - startups are about execution more than idea
575003644090699776 2015-03-09 18:42:06 +0100 <mwseibel> @hirokibacardi - dude no!  get users - while startups are hard they are not complicated - incumbents get killed all the time
575003393917218816 2015-03-09 18:41:06 +0100 <mwseibel> @WorldWideKellz @blackfounders @ycombinator @KaporCenter @MadeinBville - yes! @DETwaterproject is in YC this batch :)
575003122382168064 2015-03-09 18:40:02 +0100 <mwseibel> @dgoore - look at their team and at their user growth
575002954932969472 2015-03-09 18:39:22 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @cavaughn @ycombinator @blackfounders if you haven't launched - its also important to talk about your unique insight
575002804655251457 2015-03-09 18:38:46 +0100 <mwseibel> @iBibleStory hard question - if you can make it a billion dollar company - accelerator/VC is a good option - if not - bootstraping is best
575002521980137473 2015-03-09 18:37:38 +0100 <mwseibel> @hirokibacardi - it depends on your product - this really shouldn't be hard though.... what does your product do?
575002326596894720 2015-03-09 18:36:52 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator We need to be better at both - I think a lot of good black talent is wasted at big companies who pay 100k
575002056500490240 2015-03-09 18:35:47 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @cavaughn @ycombinator @blackfounders - what your product does, how big the market it, and if you've launched - traction
575001836945440768 2015-03-09 18:34:55 +0100 <mwseibel> @JamoneK yes!   http://www.amazon.com/Founders-Work-Stories-Startups-Early/dp/1430210788¬†‚Ä¶
575001582879707136 2015-03-09 18:33:55 +0100 <mwseibel> @crissysmiless - ahh - very cool - yes - I recommend applying now
575001326951665664 2015-03-09 18:32:54 +0100 <mwseibel> @cavaughn - I think a short, clear, strong video is very very helpful
575001248039993347 2015-03-09 18:32:35 +0100 <mwseibel> @elenawalom @ycombinator @blackfounders - nope
575001181753188352 2015-03-09 18:32:19 +0100 <mwseibel> @WorldWideKellz @blackfounders That is a good question!  I see folks from entertainment world starting to invest - they should be aggressive
575000536862216192 2015-03-09 18:29:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @elenawalom @hirokibacardi YES!!! - there is almost no advantage in staying stealth 99% of the time
575000436739977216 2015-03-09 18:29:21 +0100 <mwseibel> @crissysmiless apply now :) - why are you trying to make 2 products work at the same time?
575000315000320000 2015-03-09 18:28:52 +0100 <mwseibel> @WorldWideKellz @blackfounders @GoogleVentures - launch fast, get users, talk to them, and make what they want, everything big started small
575000137560297472 2015-03-09 18:28:10 +0100 <mwseibel> @JamoneK - when you graduate - move to the bay area
575000034703360000 2015-03-09 18:27:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator - we have!  http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-demographics¬† - because the opportunity to start the next google should be open to all
574999806508056576 2015-03-09 18:26:51 +0100 <mwseibel> @JamoneK great question! After college - get a coding job at a startup in the bay area - I can help - this sets you up to be a founder
574999580342808576 2015-03-09 18:25:57 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackstarcap what do you need an advisor to do?
574999423446482946 2015-03-09 18:25:20 +0100 <mwseibel> @ScottDigital @blackfounders @ycombinator - I don't understand the question - do you mean how can YC be beneficial?
574998918259302400 2015-03-09 18:23:19 +0100 <mwseibel> @WorldWideKellz @blackfounders yes - more minorities need to introduced to software engineering as fast as possible
574998782833643521 2015-03-09 18:22:47 +0100 <mwseibel> @hirokibacardi launch and then make something your users want
574998685647417344 2015-03-09 18:22:24 +0100 <mwseibel> @ItsMyCareer work very hard
574998632992124928 2015-03-09 18:22:11 +0100 <mwseibel> @WorldWideKellz @blackfounders can you be more specific?
574998559713439744 2015-03-09 18:21:54 +0100 <mwseibel> @Eisforinnovate @ycombinator I love it - we have a large number of health care startups in this batch
574998466511818752 2015-03-09 18:21:32 +0100 <mwseibel> @hirokibacardi open your beta!!!!  also bring users into your office to test your product
574998308491395072 2015-03-09 18:20:54 +0100 <mwseibel> @sahle that is a good question - 1) strong team working full time 2) evidence that your are building fast and launching very soon
574998078081515521 2015-03-09 18:19:59 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @blackfounders @ycombinator @sama - I had technical co-founders - if I can do it - I believe you can as well!
574997901312589824 2015-03-09 18:19:17 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator our record of successful startups - @Dropbox @Airbnb @Twitch @reddit @stripe @Instacart @coinbase @Homejoy etc..
574997570000306177 2015-03-09 18:17:58 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @blackfounders @ycombinator @sama - I'm a liberal arts person - and startups have tons of barriers - they are very hard...
574997297492176896 2015-03-09 18:16:53 +0100 <mwseibel> @WhatsThe411TV @ycombinator certainly!
574996870512164864 2015-03-09 18:15:11 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @blackfounders @ycombinator @sama - Sam is a software engineer :)
574996641352024064 2015-03-09 18:14:16 +0100 <mwseibel> @john_dry that is the right attitude!!!!  We want founders who will succeed with or without us!
574996408152948737 2015-03-09 18:13:21 +0100 <mwseibel> @justynnr - I think the first step is to move to the valley - step 2 is to apply to an accelerator like YC - we help level the playing field
574996225713291264 2015-03-09 18:12:37 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator - It has increased the amount that founders can help each other in the batch - which is great!
574996005885624321 2015-03-09 18:11:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @PowerMovesNOLA @ycombinator - tons and tons of personal outreach - i've been most successful at recruiting minority companies one on one
574995753417879552 2015-03-09 18:10:45 +0100 <mwseibel> @jigfilm you can find that information at  http://ycombinator.com/apply¬† - sure I'd love an invite
574995571041153024 2015-03-09 18:10:01 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @blackfounders @ycombinator - startups build and improve their products quickly - that usually requires a tech cofounder
574995188923260929 2015-03-09 18:08:30 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @blackfounders - what experience (professional/personal) do you have in the industry that you are creating your startup in
574994729303023616 2015-03-09 18:06:41 +0100 <mwseibel> @emceeglory - it is really hard - especially if you don't have friends/family to invest - best advice - strong team and build a fast MVP
574994572272529408 2015-03-09 18:06:03 +0100 <mwseibel> @WorldWideKellz @blackfounders - minority founders with strong and technical cofounding teams
574994261759762434 2015-03-09 18:04:49 +0100 <mwseibel> @TransformationJ @blackfounders @ycombinator - can you be more specific?
574994092423127040 2015-03-09 18:04:09 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator #AskYCMichael My YC batchmates and the YC alumni -  they are so good that they force you to work harder/smarter
574993661445808129 2015-03-09 18:02:26 +0100 <mwseibel> @justynnr #AskYCMichael - it is harder for all founders to raise outside of the valley and for minority founders I think its even harder
574993460735795200 2015-03-09 18:01:38 +0100 <mwseibel> @blackfounders @ycombinator Excited to get started!

573538848321376256 2015-03-05 17:41:31 +0100 <mwseibel> Just did an AMA on applying to YC for an Italian startup group - so much fun!  Doing my next AMA with @blackfounders on Monday!

555504196577812481 2015-01-14 23:18:15 +0100 <mwseibel> @jackyalcine Jacky - why do you think they are afraid and what can I do to remove that fear?
555503215844671488 2015-01-14 23:14:22 +0100 <mwseibel> @jackyalcine I read your post and we are leading by example. I talk to 5 - 10 minority founders everyday, giving them the best advice I can
555501414185578496 2015-01-14 23:07:12 +0100 <mwseibel> @_danilo Of course not, I want people to know that however hard it may be - it is possible and I am working hard to make it more possible

555493341152808960 2015-01-14 22:35:07 +0100 <mwseibel> @_danilo If you work for a startup or any company for 1-2 years you can save that initial cash you need to start a company
555493130028331009 2015-01-14 22:34:17 +0100 <mwseibel> @_danilo I don't understand - it doesn't take millions to start a company - I usually tell people they ned 6 months of money saved

555485832979566592 2015-01-14 22:05:17 +0100 <mwseibel> @_danilo I agree - you are exactly right that you need some cash saved up to do a startup - but that is the same for any small business
555485541479632897 2015-01-14 22:04:08 +0100 <mwseibel> @_danilo sorry I didn't see the rest of your posts - I agree!  This is a big problem!  I think the best solution is to work for a startup
